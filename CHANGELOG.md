All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and since Bareos version 20 this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- If you are relying on the fact that Bareos doesn't try to reconnect automatically on a database drop, you now have to specify it explicitly in the Catalog configuration with a `Reconnect = no` directive. [PR #860]
- when setting an IPv6 address using the `[DIR|SD|FD] Addresses` directive, now bareos only listens on IPv6 instead of both IPv4 and IPv6 on dual-stack. If you were using the `[DIR|SD|FD] Addresses` directive to create a dual-stack socket that would listen on both IPv6 AND IPv4, it will not work that way anymore. You should now also explicitly specify the IPv4 address in the directive [PR #882]
