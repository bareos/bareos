          Release Notes for Bacula 2.0.0

  Bacula code: Total files = 438 Total lines = 154,329 (*.h *.c *.in)

==== IMPORTANT Catalog update required =====
- The database format has been updated from what was used in    
  Bacula 1.38.x.  You must manually update your database before 
  running Bacula 1.39.x or higher.  If you are using Bacula supplied
  RPMs this is not necessary as the RPM does it automatically.
  Please backup your previous version of the database before
  running the update.  The update script will be automatically
  installed in your scripts directory, or can also be found in
  <bacula-source>/src/cats.  It is called:

     ./update_bacula_tables

  It is necessary to run it only once the first time you move to
  a 2.0.0.  Upgrading the Bacula version thereafter does not
  require updating the database again.  Depending on the size of
  your database the script make take a bit of time, to run, but
  in general, it should be very fast.

==== IMPORTANT new Win32 install procedure =====
  For Win32 migrations from versions prior to 1.39.0 nothing special
  needs to be done to upgrade.  Everything should be taken care of
  automatically.  The only thing not done is to delete the old C:\bacula
  directory mostly out of paranoia.

==== IMPORTANT miscellaneous ====
- The Gnome console program (gconsole) no longer functions as it
  should.More importantly, in restore mode, the restore tree is
  no longer shown in the left pane.  I suspect this is due to
  incompatible changes in the GTK+ API, and hence have given up
  on gnome and gtk+, as this has already happened several times
  previously.  At some point there will be a new GUI console.
- The bacula-dir.conf directive Accept Any Volume has been
  removed because it was never implemented. You must delete all
  occurrence of this directive for the Director to run. The Storage
  daemon will automatically accept any valid Volume that you mount.
- The --mandir ./configure option now points to the top level man
  directory.  The man files will be installed under mandir/man8 and
  mandir/man1 as appropriate.
- You *should* be able to use 1.38.x FDs with version 2.0.0 Director
  and SD providing you do not use any of the new features (runscript,   
  data encryption). It seems to work here, but we do not guarantee it.
- Your Director and SD must be simultaneously upgraded.
- The restore command no longer uses the MediaType as the primary method
  of finding a suitable Storage device. Normally it will select the last
  device used to write a Volume. If no storage device is defined, it
  will use the old algorithm which selects the first Storage resource  
  with the correct MediaType.
- The MD5/SHA1 hash codes kept in the database are now kept in a binary
  format compatible with the rest of the world. If you are running verify 
  jobs, you *must* do an InitCatalog or all files will show an MD5   
  difference.  Also, authentication uses the new algorithm by
  default, but *should* accept connections from older components (FD) using
  the old non-compatible algorithm. This has been tested, but more
  more testing is still needed.  
- A stock SuSE 10.1 kernel may crash when Bacula runs and accesses
  the tape drive. Workaround, load the SuSE 10.1 version 2.6.16.21-0.25
  kernel or later. The SuSE 10.2 Alpha 5 or later kernel also works.
  This problem may also be present in certain Fedora FC5 kernels.
- If you have been using the data encryption feature of 1.39.x, please
  be aware that certain combinations of encryption and other options
  with version 1.39.0 through 1.39.26 created Volume data that cannot
  be restored. We strongly recommend that anyone using encryption 
  carefully review his/her backups and at a minium do a Full backup
  with 1.39.28 of all encrypted data.  Robert Nelson has identified 
  and fixed it as follows:
     As of 1.39.27:
        No filters = Works fine
        Sparse = Works fine
        Compression = Works fine
        Encryption = Works fine
        Sparse + Compression = Works fine

        Sparse + Encryption = Restore broken
        Sparse + Compression + Encryption = Restore broken
        Compression + Encryption = Restore broken

     As of 1.39.28:
        Most combinations work, but some encrypted files are
        not properly restored.

     As of 1.39.30:
        All combinations work fine except Sparse+Encryption.

  Bottom line, if you are using data encryption, please test restoring
  data to be sure it all works correctly.
- The current Volume format written by 1.39.22 is different from
  the format written by previous versions. The two formats
  are not compatible. Thus any DVDs written prior to 1.39.22 will
  be unreadable by version 1.39.22.
- If you previously run a Bacula version prior to 1.39.30, the JobMedia
  data may not be correct for disk Volumes. This can cause incorrect
  seeking in versions after 1.39.30. If you experience what appears to
  be data I/O or integrity errors during restores, please add the
  following directive to your disk DEVICE resource in the Storage
  daemon conf file:

    Block Positioning = no

  This will turn off all seek requests during restores and avoid
  this problem.
- VSS for Windows clients is now enabled by default.
- Do not unload autochanger when doing "update slots"
- Implement mount command for autochanger, see manual.

New Features in 2.0.0:
- Turn on disk seek code for restores.
- There is a partial but reasonable translation of the Bacula
  messages for French.  To install it, first configure and build
  Bacula, then as root run:

    cd <bacula-source>/po
    make install

  If you have your locale set properly you will get the translated
  messages.
- Bacula now support Migration jobs that are documented in a new
  Migration chapter in the manual
  http://www.bacula.org/dev-manual/Migration.html
- Data encryption is now implemented and is documented in
  a new chapter of the manual at:
  http://www.bacula.org/dev-manual/Bacula_Data_Encryption.html
- Additional support for removable devices.  See the 
  Requires Mount, Mount Point, Mount Command, and Unmount
  Commands in the Storage daemon configuration chapter:
  http://www.bacula.org/dev-manual/Storage_Daemon_Configuratio.html
  Also see the Edit Codes for Mount and Unmount Directives in the
  same chapter.
- Switch the Win32 build from using Microsoft C++ to using mingw32
  cross-compiling.  The initial work was done by Howard Thomson,
  then tweaked by me.  Robert Nelson then totally reworked the
  cross-compiling code so that it not only cross-compiles, but
  also compiles on Visual Studio, and at the same time, he added
  all the current Unix features to the FD, such as selection on
  drives, encryption support, building *all* the tools, ...
- The Director and Storage daemon have now been ported to Win32.
  This code is working but should still be tested carefully
  before putting into production.
- Bacula restore and bextract can now extract non-portable Win32 data to
  any client (including Unix/Linux clients). Of course, in doing so,
  the Microsoft specific permissions and ACLs will be lost.  Thanks
  to Thorsten Engel for this code.
- The 260 character limitation for Win32 paths name lengths is now 
  eliminated thanks to Thorsten Engel. However, if you are using
  Volume Shadow Copy, please be careful to specify all the paths
  in the bacula-fd.conf file using a full path notation including
  the drive letter.
- Eric Bollengier wrote new RunScript directives that includes
  the old RunBefore/AfterJob and ClientRunBefore/AfterJob features
  plus a *lot* more, allowing you to control just about every aspect
  of running scripts.  See the manual for detailed documentation.
  http://www.bacula.org/dev-manual/Configuring_Director.html#5227
- SunOS ACLs should now work thanks to a patch from David Duchscher.
- Apply days keyword patch from Alexander.Bergolth at wu-wien.ac.at
  If this patch is applied, the number of days can be specified with
  "list nextvol days=xx"
  or
  "status dir days=xx"
  This can be used to preview the next scheduled job (and the
  next tape to be used) on Fridays if there are no scheduled jobs during
  the weekend.
- From Eric Bollengier. One can now using the bconsole wait command do:
   wait  (wait for all jobs to stop)
   wait jobid=nn
   wait jobuid=unique id
   wait job=job-name
- Volumes can now be set to Enable, Disable, or Archive. If they
  are not enabled, Volumes will not be mounted.             
  Implement update volume enable=(on|off|true|false|archived|0|1|2)
- Add Catalog message destination in Messages resource that puts the
  job report in the Log database table.
- Writing/reading DVD Volumes is much more stable -- to the point
  of being useful. Thanks to Richard Mortimer.
- Add enable/disable job=<job-name>.  This command prevents
  the specified job from being scheduled. Even when disabled,
  the job can be manually started from the console.
- The database Id records should be 32/64 bit independent now. 64 bits
  can be enabled by changing one define and changing the appropriate
  table variable. Normally, you need 64 bits only for FileId.
- Relative path specifications (i.e. ../xxx) are now permitted in
  the restore cd command.
- When running multiple simultaneous jobs, most jobs that use spooling
  will now finish faster due to a mutex optimization made by Eric
  Bollengier.
- Conf files containing UTF-8 marker at the head of the file as well as
  conf files containing Window cr/lf and Mac cr line termination characters 
  are now accepted thanks to Robert Nelson.
- Windows tray status windows are scrollable and resizable.
- Win32 external script execution is much more flexible -- handles
  spaces in names better, ...
- Lots of DVD fixes -- writing DVDs is now reported to work.
- Fix opening of database in a restricted console to respect     
  any Catalog ACL.
- Much better automatic handling of multiple database catalogs in
  the restore command.
- Permit multiple console/director resources in bconsole.conf.
  patch from Carsten Paeth calle@calle.in-berlin.de
- Character substitution in Job/JobDefs WriteBootStrap.
  from Eric Bollengier.
- Apply patch supplied in bug #656 to pass priority field
  in the run dialog to the Director in gnome console.
- Add support of encrypted data stream to bscan from Eric.
  display data_len instead of data content (may be binary).
- Add Enabled=xxx on update slots command.
- Add host:port to connect failure messages to FD and SD from Dir/
- Add WhereACL to console ACL list.  If nothing is specified, only
  the default is permitted for restore. Otherwise, *all* allows any
  path, or you can specify permitted paths. This should allow control
  over where users can restore files. This is untested.
- Install man pages with 'make install'.
- Add Media.Enabled flag to client backups for dotcmds.c
- Enforce Media.Enabled=1 for a current restore to work
- Require restore case 3 to have sqlquery permission to work.
- Add -n option to bconsole to turn off conio -- used in bweb.
- The bytes field in the terminated jobs part of the status
  command now reports in KB, MB, ... units.
- When not descending into a directory, print the File= name that
  triggered it -- makes why not descending a bit clearer
- Do not unload autochanger when doing "update slots"
- Implement mount command for autochanger
- Fix bug #462 incorrect error message printed when client script called
  from File= was not found.
- Fix bug #558 (waiting for feedback) where Bacula needs too much time to
  do a rewind on Solaris when no tape is in the drive (Solaris does not
  have the detailed errno found on Linux).  Added Solaris specific code.
  Note, this may apply to other OSes as well.
- The examples directory has a new bacula_mail_summary.sh file that
  creates a single email summary of any number of jobs. Submitted by
  Andrew J. Millar.
- Add nagios plugin to the examples directory. Submitted by
  Christian Masopust.
- Modify most restore error messages to be queued so that they
  appear at the end of the job rather than mixed with the restore
  listing where they could be "lost".
- Apply patch supplied by user (slightly modified) to fix
  correct detection of holes in block devices and FIFOs.
  Bug # 506.
- Added a report.pl program to the examples directory from Jonas Bjorklund.
- Add two new queries to query.sql provided by Arno. One
  list volumes known to the Storage device, and the other
  lists volumes possibly needing replacement (error, ...).
- Implement new code for changing userid and group at startup. This
  should get Bacula into the correct groups.
- Implement support for removable filesystems -- device type directive
  and mount, unmount directives.
- Transfer rates are now presented in a more readable format thanks
  to a user submission.
- SD is now aware of what volumes are mounted. More information is printed
  in the Status report. You must take much more care now to unmount
  devices prior to removing tapes that Bacula has open or prior to
  changing a magazine. Don't forget to do a mount afterwards or the
  device will be blocked.
- The Pool Maximum Volumes directive is now respected in all places.
- A Storage device can now be specified in a Pool resource. It will override
  all other Storage specifications.
- Most but not all directives accept true/false in place of yes/no.
- A patch from Karl Hakimian that reads JobIds, FileIndexes
  from a database table for restore.
- There are a number of new tables. Some such as the Location table are
  designed for user use in doing Volume Management software.
- Maximum Changer Wait, Maximum Open Wait, Maximum Rewind Wait to
  accept time qualifiers.
- Implement jobuid to replace old usage of job in keywords as
  suggested by Eric Bollengier.
- Implement write variables for Python to set Priority (anytime), and
  Job Level, only during JobInit event.
- Use the keyword ujobid to mean the unique job id; job or jobname
  to mean the Job name given on the Name directive, and jobid to
  be the numeric (non-unique) job id.
- Allow the SD to use multiple drives during a backup/restore (only
  one at a time).
- Integrate addition of line count limitation to bsmtp -l from
  Sebastian Stark <stark at tuebingen.mpg.de>
- Split the bacula start/start script into four files:
   bacula         -- starts and stops calling other scripts
   bacula-ctl-dir -- starts/stops the director
   bacula-ctl-fd  -- starts/stops the File daemon
   bacula-ctl-sd  -- starts/stops the Storage daemon
- Remove automatic case folding on Windows FDs. You must
  explicitly use the 'Ignore Case = yes' option.
- Implement wild program in tools directory for testing
  wild-cards. Almost identical to the regex program.
- Use the new bregex.c to implement Regex expressions on Win32.
- Apply patch from Christopher Hull
  - Allow multiple connections to database with different
    parameters.
  - Invalidate the scheduler when doing a reload. Fixes seg
    fault, but still 60 second window.
  - Additional info in Reschedule message.
  - Use set_jcr_job_status() everywhere to prevent loss of
    cancel, error.
  - Display peer IP in FD if error from connecting DIR.
  - Don't increment file count for DIRBEGIN.
  - Replace illegal characters in Win32 filename by _.
  - Add SE_CREATE_PERMANENT_NAME privilege in Win32.
  - Hash hard link filenames rather than linked list (performance).
  - Fix for security failure in chdir on Win32.
  - Add CreateDirectoryA/W win32 API entry points.
- programs to duplicate Bacula's base64 algorithm using standard
  routines. This fixes bugs #296, and 565. Patch submitted by
  author of bug #565.
- Fixes to reloading the Dir conf file from Eric Bollengier and Christopher
  Hull.
- Modify LICENSE to correct some problems pointed out by Debian.
- Apply a patch submitted by cesarb in bug #606 to implement O_NOATIME support.
    O_NOATIME is a open() flag which makes it possible to read a file without
    updating the inode atime (and also without the inode ctime update which
    happens if you try to set the atime back to its previous value). It also
    prevents a race condition when two programs are reading the same file, but
    only one does not want to change the atime. It's most useful for backup
    programs and file integrity checkers (and bacula can fit on both
    categories).                                                    
  You enable it in the Bacula FileSet Options resource by setting:
     noatime = yes
  The effect of this option is similar to the keepatime option except
  it is more efficient and avoids modifying ctime.
- Implement a pile of new man pages contributed by Jose Tallon.
- Modify the database format for handling Migration jobs:
   Add PriorJobId, RealEndTime to Job table
   Delete MAC table
   Remove Stripe from JobMedia record (not used, wasting space)
   Add ScratchPoolId, RecyclePoolId, Enabled to Media record
   Add Cost to Location table.
   Enabled to Media table and Location table.
- Security: harden authentication failure in FD by single threading errors
  and forcing a 6 second wait.
- If using GCC (actually g++) add the following compiler flags
  -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
- Turn on new bsnprintf() code.  The reason for this code is to
  eliminate the security problems associated with using the
  system libraries print routines.
- Implement job report that indicates where Storage and Pool
  came from -- with overrides and Pool storage and NextPool,
  it is all very complicated.
- Add more detail (Storage, Device) to list of volumes printed
  for restore.
- Add new VOLMGMT message class. No messages are yet sent with this 
  class.
- Improved Bacula rescue procedures -- see the Disaster Recovery
  chapter of the manual
- Add spooling/despooling info in status output of SD.
- Add Comment field to llist of a volume.
- Allow true/false in many but not all yes/no directives.
- The Bacula source code is now copyrighted by the Free Software 
  Foundation Europe. The Developer's Guide documents the new procedures,
  and the LICENSE file has been updated.
- Apply Jaime Ventura's patch that implements the Messages resource
  Mail On Success directive.
- The Client returns its Version string, which is printed in the Job
  report.
- The Client returns whether or not VSS and Encryption are used, which
  are printed in the Job report.

Additional Features Added for Win32:
- Added DriveType directive to the Director's Include Option FileSet
  resource.  Allowed values are: fixed, removable, cdrom, and remote.  There
  is only an implementation for Windows because it is the only platform that
  has the concept of drives.
 
- Adds EnhancedWild directive to the Director's Include Option FileSet
  resource.  Allowed values are: yes and no.
 
  When EnhancedWild is enabled then the processing of the
  Wild, WildDir and WildFile is changed in the following ways.
 
  Patterns conform to Posix
      \ is not a special character in character classification []
      To match a - it must be the first or last character
      To match a ] it must be the first character
 
      fnmatch option FNM_FILE_NAME is specified * doesn't match a / 
      so it won't match multiple directory levels in a path
 
- Relative WildFile patterns (ones without a leading /) match
  against the filename portion.  This in combination with the
  FNM_FILE_NAME fnmatch() flag makes directives such as WildFile =
  abc*.def work as expected.
 
- Adds support for the shell's feature of brace expansion.

  Here is an example where braces allow 24 lines to be expressed in 5.

  # Exclude directories full of lots and lots of useless little files
  WildDir = "[A-Z]:/{Documents and Settings,{WINNT,Windows}/Profiles}/*/Cookies"
  WildDir = "[A-Z]:/{Documents and Settings,{WINNT,Windows}/Profiles}/*/Recent"
  WildDir = "[A-Z]:/{Documents and Settings,{WINNT,Windows}/Profiles}/*/{Local Settings,LOCALS~1}/History"
  WildDir = "[A-Z]:/{Documents and Settings,{WINNT,Windows}/Profiles}/*/{Local Settings,LOCALS~1}/Temp"
  WildDir = "[A-Z]:/{Documents and Settings,{WINNT,Windows}/Profiles}/*/{Local Settings,LOCALS~1}/Temporary Internet Files"
