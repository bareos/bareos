          Release Notes for Bacula 1.32

  Bacula code: Total files = 259 Total lines = 77,740 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- Implemented forward space file/block whenever possible 
  during restore. Restoring a small number of files is now  
  much faster.
- There is a new option to restore that allows you   
  to restore files based on their Filename. You can
  also specify a file to read which contains the list.
- Added ClientRunBeforeJob and ClientRunAfterJob.
- Implemented Include | and < in File daemon.
- Automatic labeling of tape Volumes should work now.
- Recycling has been completely restructured and should work.
- Implemented full length time interval qualifiers (e.g
  "5n is now "5 min" or "5 minutes". A modifier is now required!
- Fixed gnome-console to compile with RH9 (Gnome 2.0)
- Implemented "list nextvol job=xxx", which displays the
  next volume to be used by job xxx. The Volume name to
  be used is also added to the "status dir" output.
- Lots of fixes with variable expansion and counter variables
- Implemented a new Include/Exclude syntax.
- While writing a tape, an end of file mark will be written
  every 1Gb. This makes restores faster. If you want to
  change this use "Maximum File Size" in the SD Device
  resource.


Other Changes this Release:
- A warning message is sent when a job starts that will be
  blocked because the user did an "unmount".
- Block checksum errors if any are printed in the job report.
- Implemented a single routine to read_records. It also returns
  a different record packet for each session.  This means
  that multiple simultaneous jobs should work.
- Added SDConnectTimeout to FD.    
- Lots of doc enhancements
- Fixed a PurgeOldestVolume bug (VolStatus not returned)
- Don't crash if DB address record not specified.
- Return VolStatus on find_next_volume.
- Use alist for incexe name_list.
- Use bget_dirmsg() everywhere possible when talking to FD.
- Delete old semaphore job and workq job scheduling code.
- edit_run_codes in one place (/lib)  Add Job name
- Update query.sql to find current backups correctly.
- Correct ambiguous SQL statement for pruning.
- Set heartbeat interval to zero by default.
- Fix a possible race condition in stopping the 
  heartbeat thread.
- Eliminate gnome2-console directory. Everything is in gnome-console
- Enhanced "packet too big" message to indicate who sent it.
- Corrected console prompt problem in non-readline versions.
- Correct a number of variable expansion problems.
- Added a number of new regression tests.
- In an attempt to make configuration a bit less confusing, I've changed
  the name of a number of variables. The old ones still work, but will
  be phased out over time. FDAddress, FDPassword, SDAddress SDPassword,
  SDDeviceName, and DBPassword.
- A possible fix to the very intermittent SD crashes that Alex gets.

  time interval specifications.
