              Technical notes on version 1.37  
                        Kern Sibbald

General:

Changes to 1.37.42:
26Oct05
- Return HARDEOF status from bnet_recv() if bsock NULL rather 
  than aborting.
- Don't overwrite pthreadVCE.dll or msvcr71.dll during Win32 
  install.
- Update README.win32 instructions.
25Oct05 
- Make db_get_job_record() return Name so that the ACL
  can be checked.  Fixes bug #446
22Oct05
- Insure that all the SD tools init the Autochanger
  resources.

Changes to 1.37.41:
22Oct05
- Print error message if no Changer Command found.
- Apply fix from Martin Simmons to clear structure before
  using it in IPADDR -- fixes a bind() bug on AIX.
14Oct05
- Add NetBSD fstype patch from Geert Hendrickx <ghen@telenet.be>
- Update num_parts only when writing to DVD.
13Oct05
- Fix error conditions in bpipe.c DVD routine (terminate buffer).
- Use a bigger buffer 32K as suggested by Arno in bpipe.c.
- Increase dvd mount timeout with patch from Arno.
- Modify DVD code so that it keeps a state flag that indicates
  when the freespace variable is valid. freespace_errno, now has
  either 0 or an errno. There are no negative errnos.
- Create is_freespace_ok() to test state flag. Also, set_freespace_ok()
  and clear_freespace_ok(). Modify code to use them.  This
  simplifies a bit the logic of the freespace code.
- Edit 64bit debug values correctly in dvd.c
- Fix %e variable to check num_parts rather than part.
- Use static buffer instead of static buffers for FI_to_ascii()
  and stream_to_ascii() debug routines in SD. This is to prevent
  possible race conditions between two threads (possibly Phil's
  unmount problem).
12Oct05
- Add a .dir command that separates arguments with commas. It
  is intended to be used in the tree routines to get a 
  machine readable output for GUIs like wx-console.
- Make configure set dvd-handler to have execute permission.
- Install dvd-handler as is done for other dvd-xxx scripts.
- In block.c call dvd_write_part() to write last part rather
  than dvd_open_next_part().
- Prefix some DVD subroutines with dvd_
11Oct05
- Add extra debug to Update media error for VolFiles decrease
  error.
- Do not update dev->file on set_ateof() for non-tape.
10Oct05
- Mark DVD volume in error if part cannot be written.
- If a DVD is mounted, unmount it before asking operator
  to mount an different one.
- Add Arno's dvd-handler script to the scripts directory and
  integrate with configure.  It replaces both existing scripts.
- Make default schedule start at 23:10
- Implement gui release in Makefile. It creates two .tar.gz
  bacula-web and bimagemgr.
08Oct05
- Add README plus tar release to gui project.
- Manual documentation
- Tweak bacula.man doc
- Add PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL; to SQLite3 tables. This
  speeds up SQLite3 so it is only about 10% slower than version
  2.xx.  Thanks to Russell Howe for this tip.
- Add msvcr71.dll to pebuilder .inf file as it is needed by
  Bacula FD.  Thanks to Brandon for passing this fix to Scott.
05Oct05
- Add VolumePurged method to Python JobEvents class.  Fixes
  bug #428 (I think).
- Add JobId index to File table for MySQL.
- Correct tray-monitor crash of bacula-dir. qstatus_cmd()  
  code referenced the wrong pointer. Fixes bug #438.
- Add bacualnovss.mak file from Martin.
- Remove Pool from restore string in wbrestorepanel.cpp. Patch
  from user for bug #433.
- Correct code in wbrestorpanel.cpp with misplaced parens. Patch
  from user for bug #431

  catalog_update().
24Sep05
- Fix mode change open in btape.c
- Use nonblocking opens on Linux only.
- Move set_blocking code for tapes into method to
  simplify main line code.

  DIR. This fixes a bug with bad numbers of files on a tape
  when it filled as reported by Peter.
- In release_device() do not update the DIR on the Volume
  info if the the information was already written at the
  end of the tape.

  only a DCR as the argument.
- Rework the reserve_device_for_append() in stored to wait
  if the drive is not available.  Note! This is a short
  term solution.
25Mar05
- Comment out Multiple Connections in the document.
- Move the P() and V() to subroutines so that they can be accessed
  from class methods. The reference to strerror() caused problems.
- Implement new DEVICE class methods block() and unblock() that
  do what was previously done in 3 lines of code.
- Implement wait_for_device(), which will wait for any device
  to be released then return. This requires a new global mutex
  and condition variable, and is implemented in src/stored/wait.c

  failed the job to use the new device wait code.
22Mar05
- Apply reschedule patch to 1.37 code.

  for an autochanger and avoids spurious messages.
- Change all yes/no to yes|no in the manual.
- Fix win32 create_file.c typo.
- Fix a typo in an error message.
17Mar05

- Fix a rather ugly problem with the PoolId not getting
  passed correctly. Now the DIR passes the Pool name and
  Media Type to the SD, who passes them back when requesting
  the next Volume. The DIR then looks up the correct PoolId.
  This takes more time, but always works, AND allows wild
  card Media Types (i.e. the SD can decide).
- The DIR <==> SD protocol has changed.

Changes to 1.37.6:
11Mar05

  using .tex in place of .wml.
08Mar05
- Copy latest config.sub and config.guess from autoconf.

  cloning a job as many times as you want.
- Pass PoolId to SD on Query request. It is now used in the
  Find_media catalog request.
- Reworked the Device resource in the DIR. Eliminated num_waiting
  and use_count, but added max_writers, reserved, and PoolId.

  to support cloning.
- Implemented store_alist_str() to allow multiple string items
  to be specified in a .conf file.

  pruning.
- Add more database fields and fix the update scripts to
  include the new items.
- Pass actual level to FD so that ClientRun editing can reflect
  correct level -- ditto for job status. This makes the DIR
  incompatible with older clients!

  the code logic becomes clearer. This is in preparation for
  actually using the new Device resources.
- Fix some lower case problems in sql_cmds.c reported by
  Debian.

  which enforces console ACLs in the status command for Jobs.
15Feb05
- Fix Media LabelDate and FirstWritten to be correctly set.
- Fix deadlock in multiple simultaneous jobs.
- Fix tape "truncation"/"number of files" after restore bug.
10Feb05
- Ensure that correct error messages are returned when
  reading an ANSI label.
09Feb05
- Modified ANSI label code to preserve any ANSI label 
  already found by skipping over it rather than rewriting
  it.
- Split the ANSI label code into ansi_label.c
- Do not let user relabel an ANSI labeled tape.
- Applied a patch for the console help command supplied
  in a bug report. 
- Added some new dev methods. Most notably was
  set_eof(), which handles setting all the dev variables
  when an EOF is just read. This is now used most everywhere
  in the code.
07Feb05

  If this is set, it will force writing of the appropriate
  label type.
- Added Check Labels = yes|no to Device resource in SD. If this
  is set, Bacula will check for ANSI labels and accept them,      
  otherwise, ANSI labels will not be accepted when the tape
  is first mounted.
02Feb05
- Second cut ANSI labels.
01Feb05
- Merge Preben's patch for ACLs and for Mac OS X resource forks.
- Some doc updates.
- Display more informative message when a device was not
  found or could not be opened.
- Add the sqlite3 database scripts. 
- Add some patches for 1.36.1 (note, I have now prepared
  a 1.36.2 with all the patches and some new features --
  to be documented).
- Some minor doc updates.
- Add Arno's baculareport.pl script to the examples directory.
29Jan05 -- after vacation
- Add support for SQLite3 (it seems to run at 1/2 the speed
  of SQLite2).  Use --with-sqlite3 instead of --with-sqlite
  to get SQLite3.
- Add target for running qemu to boot Rescue CDROM
- Add code to support kernel 2.6 in Rescue CDROM -- does NOT yet
  boot correctly.
- Implement ANSI labels -- not yet tested.
  This required changes to DB format. No upgrade script yet.
  Note, more work needed to modify "update" command to handle
  changing label types, also must restrict volume name lengths
  to 6 characters.
- Add new Device, Storage, and MediaType records to DB. No
  upgrade script yet.
- Add MediaType to bsr file record types. Not yet used in SD.
- Permit multiple device specifications in Storage resource in 
  Dir conf file.
- Implement Device resources. Director requests Device resource
  info from SD on startup. 
- Note!!!! DIR->SD incompatible with previous versions.
- Remove multiple Storage definitions in Job resource.  One can
  still specify multiple Storage resources, but they all go into
  a single alist, and imply sending data to each Storage daemon 
  simultaneously.
- Implement Device query command between DIR and SD.
- Allow DIR to "reserve" a Device. It will then be acquired
  when the FD connects to the SD.
- Turn all DIR resources into classes, and implement a few class
  methods -- more to come.
- Turn DEVICE in SD into a class, and implement a number of inline
  class methods -- more to come.
- I had serious problems with ACL errors on my Laptop, and so had
  to add the following patch:
  @@ -181,7 +181,7 @@
      }
      /***** Do we really want to silently ignore errors from acl_get_file
        and acl_to_text?  *****/
  -   return -1;
  +   return 0;
   }
- Added edit_int64()
- Reworked and tested a bit the htable routines.
- Major changes to SD acquire.c -- DIR can now reserve devices. Needs
  lots of testing!!!!
- Made a special state code for DVD -- this simplifies the logic
  of the code, but I probably broke it. Testing needed!!!!
- Add AutoChanger resource to SD, but not yet used.

Changes to 1.37.2:
12Jan05
- Integrate Preben 'Peppe' Guldberg <peppe@wielders.org>'s

  and old restore.c in filed. Also turn off code in new
  acl.c because of errors.  The new code, when fully implemented
  moves platform specific code into acl.c.
  One of the patches also implements WildFile and WildDir -- thanks.
01Jan05
- Implement Python in the SD (no events yet though).
- Fix some typos in the previous commit.
30Dec04
- Enhance CDROM boot to include some documentation at boot time.

    boot sequence has changed significantly. Updates to come
    later.
- Add memtest option to CDROM boot.
- Include Nicolas' changes to fix llist JobMedia records.

  three patches that clean up white space:
  ws.patch.02.strings:
    Breaks strings that span lines into concatenated strings. I am not sure
    if you like this one. Other code works with concatenated strings, though.
  ws.patch.03.trailing:
    This removes trailing whitespace. No changes resulted from this for
    my setup.
  ws.patch.04.leading:
    This replaces space runs at the start of line with tabs. No changes
    again.
- Fix overriding storage specification to be done
  through a subroutine.
- Fix autoconf so it runs with FC3. 
- Add Python4.3 to configure search paths.

- Update rescue disk to include mkinitrd
- Fix umount_drives in rescue disk (only one arg to umount)
- Ensure that if SD is manually set in Console, it is used.
- Put generate_event on pointer and plug it in init. This
  permits using it in /lib
- Correct despooling size reported to be Job specific rather
  than for the whole drive.
18Dec04
- Fix bug 207. jcr use count off by one when manually
  scheduling jobs.
- Remove FNMATCH test in configure.in and always use
  the one in our library to get the FN_CASEFOLD GNU
  extensions on all platforms.
- While using the rescue CDROM after my computer would not
  boot, I realized that it would be very useful to have
  a umount_disks. So, it is not implemented, along with
  updates to the READMEs and some minor tweaks.
- Moved mounting the CDROM in the rescue boot from /cdrom
  to /mnt/cdrom (more standard location).
- Reboot in CDROM rescue should now work -- requires -d
  option (no write) to work.

  problems with networking in lib. Bugs 190 and 204.
  Cleaned up a lot of #ifdefing problems by using routines
  in address_conf.c
