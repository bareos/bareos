Bareos file daemon package builder for Mac OS X
===============================================

This package build script lets you download, compile and package the bareos
file daemon easily with a single command line. Beside the bareos file daemon
the resulting installer package contains a short ReadMe file with instructions
on how to install and use the software. Also a basic launchd property list is
included along with preugrade and postflight installer scripts to stop and
restart the daemon while upgrading. To ensure the security of the users the
passwords in the configuration files are generated during a first time
installation and file permissions are checked and corrected on upgrades.

Requirements:
* Mac OS X 10.5 or later (building/packaging), 10.4 or later (deployment)
* Mac OS X developer tools installed

Example (compile and create package from within bareos source tree):

platforms/osx/configure.sh
make -C platforms/osx/ all


make -c platforms/osx all
creates a pkg package file and from this a dmg file.
Instead of the parameter "all", you can call it also with "pkg" or "dmg".

If you don't want to create packages, you can use following commands to install it directly:

platforms/osx/configure.sh
make
make install DESTDIR="$DESTDIR"


By moving the contents of platforms/osx to some other directory (e.g.
~/bareos-standalone-bulder), it is possible to create installer packages from
older bareos versions and for specific platforms.

Examples (standalone mode):
 1. Create an installer package from the newest supported bareos source
    containing the bareos file daemon as a PPC/Intel universal binary.
    $ make dmg

 2. Create an installer package from a specified version of the bareos source
    containing the bareos file daemon as a PPC/Intel universal binary.
    $ make dmg BAREOS_VERSION=3.0.0

 3. Create an installer package from the newest supported bareos source
    containing the bareos file daemon for PPC architecture only.
    $ make dmg ARCHFLAGS="-arch ppc" PACKAGE_TITLE="Bareos File Daemon PPC x.y.z"

 4. Create an installer package from a specified version of the bareos source
    containing the bareos file daemon for the current architecture.
    $ make dmg BAREOS_VERSION=2.4.4 ARCHFLAGS=""

You find the built disk images in the products folder.

Misc commands:
  1. Cleanup the build directory
     $ make clean
  2. Additionally remove the downloads and products:
     $ make distclean

Additional notes on the build-script:
  * The following *FLAGS are used tu build universal binary with 10.4 SDK:
    CPPFLAGS=-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.4
    CFLAGS=-O -g -arch i386 -arch ppc
    CXXFLAGS=${CFLAGS}
    LDFLAGS=-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 -arch i386 -arch ppc
