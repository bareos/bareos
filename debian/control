#
# when using
# configure --enable-dynamic-debian-package-list
# the file debian/control will be generated (overwritten)
# from configure by the template debian/control.in.
# While this makes building more flexible,
# it does not comply with Debian Packaging Policy.
# Therefore when building packages for Debian.org,
# the statical debian/control will be used.
#

# we use conditional build-depends based on build profiles
# to get the right build-depends just fill DEB_BUILD_PROFILES
# with your distribution and codename (i.e. "debian buster"
# or "ubuntu xenial") and you'll get the full build-depends.
# Otherwise you will just get the common build-depends and
# might miss a feature or two.
