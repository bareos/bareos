Bareos Regression Suite and CTest
==================================================================

Thanks to Frank Sweetser, the Bareos regression scripts have now been modified
to use the ctest component of cmake.  The major gain from this, since Bareos
already had a working test framework in place, is the ability to have the
results of each test submitted to a centralized dashboard system.  All of the
test results are aggregated and summarized, where all of the developers can
quickly see how the regression tests are running.
====

How to Use CTest
==================================================================

For more complete documentation on ctest, go to:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake#CTest

The first step is to install the cmake package, which includes ctest.  If your
distribution does already package it, you can download it directly from the
source:

http://www.cmake.org

Next, you must edit your regression config file and add a paramter called
SITE_NAME to identify the machine running the tests.  Ideally, it should
contain something to identify yourself to whoever is viewing the test results
as well as something to allow you to identify which machine is running the
tests, ie

SITE_NAME=kern-bareos-gumbie

Once you have cmake installed, you can perform one of two different kinds of
runs to submit test results.  The most common kind will be Nightly runs.  A
Nightly CTest backup will update the source directory (as defined by the
BAREOS_SOURCE setting in your config file) to the current version, run the
specified list of tests, and submit all of the results to the server.  Note
that all of the results in a given 24 hour period (starting at 9pm EST) are
lumped together to appear as a single block, rather than each test showing up
as a different run.

The simplest way to trigger a nightly run is to use one of the two provided
scripts.  The nightly-all script will run all non root tests, both tape and
disk based, while the nightly-disk script will run only the disk based tests.
So, you can choose between the following scripts:

 cd <regress>
 ./nightly-all         # does disk and tape testing
 ./nightly-disk        # disk only tests

 ./experimental-all    # experimental disk and tape testing
 ./experimental-disk   # experimental disk testing

We recommend that you start with the ./experimental-disk runs so that
you can check that everything is working fine.  Once that is done,
try a nightly-xxx run.  The difference is the experimental runs are just
that -- they are things where you are experimenting and it is expected that
something might be broken (bad ctest configuration, experimental source
code, ...), and nightly runs are not expected to fail.

If you are a developer and you have modified your local Git repository, you
should be running the experimental tests -- they are designed for developers.
If you do modify your local repository and commit it, then run a nightly
test.

If you are just doing testing on a nightly basis (no development in your
source repository), then please use the nightly tests.

All the old scripts (./do_all, do_file, all-non-root-tests, ...) manually
run the tests outside of ctest.

Periodically, however, you may want to submit a single test separately from a
weekly run.  This may be a test of a particular patch you're working on, or
perhaps a new OS patch.  For these one-shot tests, you will want to manually
run ctest in Experimental mode, something like:

REGRESS_DEBUG=1 ctest -D Experimental -R all-non-root:auto-label-test

The '-D Experimental' option tells ctest to submit the test results as
Experimental instead of Nightly.  We reccomend you use the REGRESS_DEBUG
environmental variable to ensure that any errors from the test are logged in
the dashboard (all of the ctest wrapper scripts set it).  The '-R <pattern>'
option gives ctest a regular expression.  Any tests with a name as defined in
DartTestfile.txt that matches the pattern will be run.

Note that you must have run ./scripts/do_sed at least once already in order to
use Experimental mode.
====

Updating and Building Within CTest:
==================================================================
Before each Nightly run, ctest will automatically update the BAREOS_SOURCE
directory, and submit these updates along with the test results.  Any
Experimental runs will not.

Before either type of run actually begins running tests, ctest will run the
script scripts/update-ctest.  This script first compares the version of
BUILD_SOURCE with that of the build/ directory.  If the two versions differ, or
if the build/ directory does not exist, it will automatically run 'make setup'
for you.
====

Viewing the Dashboard:
==================================================================
You can view the dashboard at:

http://regress.bareos.org/index.php?project=bareos

Results will not be visible as soon as they are submitted to the server.
Processing is currently done every 10 minutes, so you may have to wait up to 15
minutes or so before your results show up.

Getting CTest running on Solaris (thanks to Robert Hartzell):
============================================================
The regression is working in zone on opensolaris build 126

 create a zone and install these pkg's:
    SUNWcmake, SUNWmysql5, SUNWlibm, gcc-dev
    SUNWgtar, SUNWgit, SUNWperl584usr,
    and most of SUNWgnu*

 In the config file I edited the "WHICHDB=" line to read:
     WHICHDB="--with-mysql=/usr/mysql/5.0"

 And then in the shell:
 $ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/mysql/5.0/lib/mysql -R/usr/mysql/5.0/lib/mysql"
 $ PATH=/usr/gnu/bin:$PATH

 When i first ran "make setup" it failed... couldn't create the database
 so I had to run /usr/mysql/5.0/bin/mysql -u root mysql and do this:
    grant all privileges on regress.* to ''@localhost;
    grant all privileges on regress.* to ''@"%";

CTest script details:
=========================================================
Email from Frank describing the flow when running a ctest and some of the
problems that come up.

0. Start off with a local Git repository at version A, and the master
repository at version B.

1. nightly-disk is started.

2. nightly-disk runs scripts/config_dart

3. config_dart runs scripts/create_sed

4. create_sed pulls bversion and bdate out of the current local repo, so gets
version A values.

5. config_dart then creates DartConfiguration.tcl from the .in file, leaving a
BuildName parameter of A.

6. nightly-disk then runs 'ctest -D Nightly'.  This implicitly tells ctest to
perform Update, Configure, Build, Test, and Submit stages, in that order.

7. The Update stage runs 'git pull' on the local repository.  The local
repository is now updated to version B from the master, but since the
DartConfiguration.tcl file was already created and has not been updated, the
Update.xml file has the version A BuildName still.

8. Next, the Configure stage runs.  Since the configure process is handled in
tandem with the build process by 'make setup', this just calls /bin/true so as
to not throw any false errors, and can effectively be treated as a no-op.

9. Next is the Build stage, which is handled by calling scripts/update-ctest.

10.  update-ctest checks the Git versions of regress/build vs BAREOS_SOURCE.
Since the two are different (regress/build is still version A, while
BAREOS_SOURCE has been updated to B) it calls 'make setup'.

11. 'make setup' copies BAREOS_SOURCE to regress/build and configures and
builds it.  It then calls scripts/do_sed

12. do_sed calls scripts/config_dart again.  Since regress/build has been
updated to B, it regenerates DartConfiguration.tcl with a version B BuildName.

13. ctest now generates the Build.xml results file, but since BuildName was
still A while this stage began, this is what appears in the XML BuildName.

14. Done with the Build stage, ctest moves on to the Test stage, where it
actually calls the various test/ scripts as defined by DartTestfile.txt and
filtered by the -R option.  At this point, since ctest is beginning a new
stage, it appears to re-read DartConfiguration.tcl (I believe this is intended
to allow ctest to bootstrap itself in a virgin cmake managed source code tree,
where the test configuration should be generated by cmake).  The final
Test.xml file, therefore, contains a version B BuildName string, as opposed to
all previous steps, which have version A.

15. Finally, ctest flings the results at the dashboard.  The dashboard does
ignores in what order or grouping XML files are submitted, and instead uses
the site/buildname tuple to distinguish them (at least for Nightly runs, I'm
not so sure about Experimental ones).  In this case, instead of one complete
run, the dashboard sees two runs, one of which is Update through Make, and a
second one which is Test only.

For a sample of the problem, take a look at the fsweetser 2.3 sqlite3 Nightly
runs at

http://regress.bareos.org:8081/Bareos/Dashboard/Dashboard?trackid=29

The Update and Build information show up with a BuildName of
bareos-2.­3.­10-26Feb08-Linux-sqlite3, then aftegit pull hit the Test
information shows up with bareos-2.­3.­11-03Mar08-Linux-sqlite3.  (Ignore for
the moment the fact my timestamps are at 6:59PM, rather than at 9PM where
they're supposed to be; this seems to be a Fedora specific client side issue I
haven't tracked down yet.)

Looking more closely at the test submitted to the public dashboard
(http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php), I get the impression that the
BuildName parameter was misnamed, and intended to be treated more as a build
platform name, rather than the name of the build being tested.  Rather than
create a hook to tag the version being tested, everyone as far as I can tell
just seems to rely on the timestamp of the test.
======

Important Note:
======================================================================
NOTE !!!!!!!!! ctest can actually back out changes that have been made to
your local source repository (this was true for SVN, but I (Kern) am
not sure it is true now that we have switched to git).

As a consequence, it is probably better not to
use a directory in which you are developing code for Nightly tests.  Seee the
below explanation given by Frank Sweetser.

When a Nightly run is done, the timestamp is set to the last occurring
instance of the time defined by the NightlyStartTime parameter.  The piece
that I missed is that, in addition to using that timestamp for reporting to
the dashboard, the update stage also uses that point in time to determine
exactly which version of the repository to check out.

So if you make commit changes at 10PM EST, and then run a Nightly test run,
the NightlyStartTime of 9PM EST will back out those changes in the local
repository.  Any subsequent runs that are started at 9PM EST the following day
or later will include them.  This implies to me that NightlyStartTime should
be set such that you don't expect any developers to commit any changes in
between NightlyStartTime and the time at which the ctest run actually starts.

The alternative is to make use of the Experimental track.  While it normally
just uses the local source tree as is, you can manually have it update:

ctest -D ExperimentalUpdate

Unlike Nightly, this will update to whatever the latest version of the
repository is.
