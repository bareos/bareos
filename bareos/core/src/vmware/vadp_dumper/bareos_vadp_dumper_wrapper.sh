  Your system does not have /sys/class/scsi_disk/ which is required for
  VADP dumper due to a bug in VMware's VDDK. Please load the sd_mod
  kernel module and make sure /sys/class/scsi_disk/ exists.
  You can do this temporarily by running "modprobe sd_mod" as root.
  Please refer to your OS documentation how to persist this change across reboots.
