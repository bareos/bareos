 * @file
 * Define integer types for Bareos
 *
 * Integer types.  These types should be be used in all
 * contexts in which the length of an integer stored on
 * removable media must be known regardless of the
 * architecture of the platform.
 *
 * Bareos types are:
 *
 * int8_t,  int16_t,  int32_t,  int64_t
 * uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t
 *
 * Also, we define types such as file address lengths.
