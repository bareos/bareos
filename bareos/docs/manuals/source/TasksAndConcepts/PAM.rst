Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
======================================

Introduction
------------

Before Bareos Version 18.2 authentication with a Bareos Director is done primarily by a named Console connection. Name and password are set in the regarding Bareos Console or |WebUI| configuration resource. Starting with Bareos Version 18.2 it is also possible to use Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to authenticate a user indenpendently from the Console Resource.

As consequence a dedicated named Console or |WebUI| configuration must be used to establish a connection to a Bareos Director Daemon. This connection has name and password credentials, but only to establish an encrypted connection to the Director. To be able to authenticate users with PAM using this console, each user needs an additional User configuration that holds the regarding name and the Access Control List (ACL) or ACL profile. The ACL will be loaded as soon as the User is authenticated.

The credentials for user authentication comes from the PAM module which has been enabled for the Bareos Director Daemon.

For a simplified technical overview the following diagram shows the connection sequence of a Bareos Console to a Bareos Director using an interactive PAM authentication using the pam_unix.so PAM module.

More technical details can be found in the Bareos Developer Guide: :ref:`PAMDeveloperChapter`.

Configuration
-------------
To enable PAM authentication two systems have to be configured. The PAM module in the operating system and the Bareos Console.

PAM Module
^^^^^^^^^^
This is depending on the operating system and on the used pam module. For details read the manuals. The name of the service that has to be registered is **bareos**.

Fedora 28 example:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: :file:`/etc/pam.d/bareos`

   auth       required     pam_unix.so


.. warning::

   The |dir| runs as user **bareos**. However, some PAM modules require more priviliges. E.g. **pam_unix** requires access to the file :file:`/etc/shadow`, which is normally not permitted. Make sure you verify your system accordingly.

Bareos Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For PAM authentication a dedicated named console is used. Set the directive UsePamAuthentication=yes in the regarding Director-Console resource:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
  :caption: :file:`bareos-dir.d/console/pam-console.conf`

  Console {
    Name = "PamConsole"
    Password = "Secretpassword"
    UsePamAuthentication = yes
  }

In the dedicated |bconsole| config use name and password according as to the |dir|:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
  :caption: :file:`bconsole.conf`

  Director {
    ...
  }

  Console {
    Name = "PamConsole"
    Password = "Secretpassword"
  }

PAM User
^^^^^^^^
Users have limited access to commands and jobs. Therefore the appropriate rights should also be granted to PAM users. This is an example of a User resource (Bareos Director Configuration):

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
  :caption: :file:`bareos-dir.d/user/a-pam-user.conf`

  User {
     Name = "a-pam-user"
     CommandACL = status, .status
     JobACL = *all*
  }
