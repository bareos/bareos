Catalog Tables
==============

:index:`\ <single: Catalog>`\

Bareos stores its information in a database, named Catalog. It is configured by :ref:`DirectorResourceCatalog`.

Job
---

:index:`\ <single: Catalog; Job>`\  :index:`\ <single: Job; Catalog>`\

JobStatus
~~~~~~~~~

:index:`\ <single: Job; JobStatus>`\  :index:`\ <single: Catalog; Job; JobStatus>`\

The status of a Bareos job is stored as abbreviation in the Catalog database table Job. It is also displayed by some bconsole commands, eg. :bcommand:`list jobs`.

This table lists the abbreviations together with its description and weight. The weight is used, when multiple states are applicable for a job. In this case, only the status with the highest weight/priority is applied.
