Monitor Configuration
=====================

.. index::
   pair: Monitor; Configuration

The Monitor configuration file is a stripped down version of the Director configuration file, mixed with a Console configuration file. It simply contains the information necessary to contact Directors, Clients, and Storage daemons you want to monitor.

For a general discussion of configuration file and resources including the data types recognized by Bareos, please see the :ref:`Configuration <ConfigureChapter>` chapter of this manual.

The following Monitor Resource definition must be defined:

-  :ref:`Monitor <MonitorResource>` – to define the Monitor’s name used to connect to all the daemons and the password used to connect to the Directors. Note, you must not define more than one Monitor resource in the Monitor configuration file.

-  At least one :ref:`Client <ClientResource1>`, :ref:`Storage <StorageResource1>` or :ref:`Director <DirectorResource2>` resource, to define the daemons to monitor.

.. _MonitorResource:

Monitor Resource
----------------

.. index::
   single: Monitor Resource
   single: Resource; Monitor

The Monitor resource defines the attributes of the Monitor running on the network. The parameters you define here must be configured as a Director resource in Clients and Storages configuration files, and as a Console resource in Directors configuration files.

.. _DirectorResource2:

Director Resource
-----------------

:index:`\ <single: Director Resource>`\  :index:`\ <single: Resource; Director>`\

The Director resource defines the attributes of the Directors that are monitored by this Monitor.

As you are not permitted to define a Password in this resource, to avoid obtaining full Director privileges, you must create a Console resource in the :ref:`Director's configuration <DirectorChapter>` file, using the Console Name and Password defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you should configure this Console resource to allow access to no other daemons, and permit the use of only two commands: status and .status (see below for an example).

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor configuration file.

.. _ClientResource1:

Client Resource
---------------

:index:`\ <single: Resource; Client>`\  :index:`\ <single: Client Resource>`\

The Client resource defines the attributes of the Clients that are monitored by this Monitor.

You must create a Director resource in the :ref:`Client's configuration <FiledConfChapter>` file, using the Director Name defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you should set the Monitor directive to Yes in this Director resource.

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor configuration file.

.. _StorageResource1:

Storage Resource
----------------

:index:`\ <single: Resource; Storage>`\  :index:`\ <single: Storage Resource>`\

The Storage resource defines the attributes of the Storages that are monitored by this Monitor.

You must create a Director resource in the :ref:`Storage's configuration <StoredConfChapter>` file, using the Director Name defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you should set the Monitor directive to Yes in this Director resource.

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor configuration file.

Traymonitor Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Traymonitor Security
   single: Security; Traymonitor

There is no security problem in relaxing the permissions on |traymonitor| configuration files as long as |fd|, |sd| and |dir| are configured properly, so the passwords contained in this file only gives access to the status of the daemons. It could be a security problem if you consider the status information as potentially dangerous (most people consider this as not being dangerous).

Concerning Director’s configuration:
In the |traymonitor| configuration files the password in the Monitor resource must point to a restricted console in |dir| configuration. So, if you use this password with :command:` bconsole`\ , you’ll only have access to the status of the director (commands status and .status). It could be a security problem if there is a bug in the ACL code of the director.

Concerning File and Storage Daemons’ configuration:
In the |traymonitor| configuration files the Name in the Monitor resource must point to a Director resource in the |fd| respectively |sd| configuration, with the Monitor directive set to Yes.

Example Traymonitor configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Traymonitor; Configuration
   single: Configuration; Tray Monitor

An example Traymonitor configuration file might be the following:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig

   #
   # Bareos Tray Monitor Configuration File
   #
   Monitor {
     Name = rufus-mon        # password for Directors
     Password = "GN0uRo7PTUmlMbqrJ2Gr1p0fk0HQJTxwnFyE4WSST3MWZseR"
     RefreshInterval = 10 seconds
   }

   Client {
     Name = rufus-fd
     Address = rufus
     FDPort = 9102           # password for FileDaemon
     Password = "FYpq4yyI1y562EMS35bA0J0QC0M2L3t5cZObxT3XQxgxppTn"
   }
   Storage {
     Name = rufus-sd
     Address = rufus
     SDPort = 9103           # password for StorageDaemon
     Password = "9usxgc307dMbe7jbD16v0PXlhD64UVasIDD0DH2WAujcDsc6"
   }
   Director {
     Name = rufus-dir
     DIRport = 9101
     address = rufus
   }

Example File daemon’s Director record

   #   status of the file daemon

     Monitor = yes

     Password = "9usxgc307dMbe7jbD16v0PXlhD64UVasIDD0DH2WAujcDsc6"
     Monitor = yes
   }
