The File Retention directive defines the length of time that Bareos will keep File records in the Catalog database after the End time of the Job corresponding to the File records.

This directive takes precedence over Client directives of the same name. For example, you can decide to increase Retention times for Archive or OffSite Pool.

Note, this affects only records in the catalog database. It does not affect your archive backups.

For more information see Client documentation about :config:option:`dir/client/FileRetention`\
