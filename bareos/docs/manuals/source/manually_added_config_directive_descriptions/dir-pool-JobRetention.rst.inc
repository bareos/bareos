The Job Retention directive defines the length of time that Bareos will keep Job records in the Catalog database after the Job End time. As with the other retention periods, this affects only records in the catalog and not data in your archive backup.

This directive takes precedence over Client directives of the same name. For example, you can decide to increase Retention times for Archive or OffSite Pool.

For more information see Client side documentation :config:option:`dir/client/JobRetention`\
