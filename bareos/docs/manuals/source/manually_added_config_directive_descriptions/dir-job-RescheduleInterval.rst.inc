If you have specified Reschedule On Error = yes and the job terminates in error, it will be rescheduled after the interval of time specified by time-specification. See :ref:`the time specification formats <DataTypeTime>` in the Configure chapter for details of time specifications. If no interval is specified, the job will not be rescheduled on error.
