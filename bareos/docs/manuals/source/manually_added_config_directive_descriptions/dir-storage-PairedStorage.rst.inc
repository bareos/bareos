For NDMP backups this points to the definition of the Native Storage that is accesses via the NDMP protocol. For now we only support NDMP backups and restores to access Native Storage Daemons via the NDMP protocol. In the future we might allow to use Native NDMP storage which is not bound to a Bareos Storage Daemon.
