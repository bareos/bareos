The Schedule directive defines what schedule is to be used for the Job. The schedule in turn determines when the Job will be automatically started and what Job level (i.e. Full, Incremental, ...) is to be run. This directive is optional, and if left out, the Job can only be started manually using the Console program. Although you may specify only a single Schedule resource for any one job, the Schedule resource may contain multiple Run directives, which allow you to run the Job at many different
times, and each run directive permits overriding the default Job Level Pool, Storage, and Messages resources. This gives considerable flexibility in what can be done with a single Job. For additional details, see :ref:`DirectorResourceSchedule`.
