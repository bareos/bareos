This directive instructs the Director to search for the oldest used Volume in the Pool when another Volume is requested by the Storage daemon and none are available. The catalog is then pruned respecting the retention periods of all Files and Jobs written to this Volume. If all Jobs are pruned (i.e. the volume is Purged), then the Volume is recycled and will be used as the next Volume to be written. This directive respects any Job, File, or Volume retention periods that you may have specified.

This directive can be useful if you have a fixed number of Volumes in the Pool and you want to cycle through them and you have specified the correct retention periods.

However, if you use this directive and have only one Volume in the Pool, you will immediately recycle your Volume if you fill it and Bareos needs another one. Thus your backup will be totally invalid. Please use this directive with care.
