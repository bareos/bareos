If this directive is set to yes, and the Device belongs to an autochanger, then when the Autochanger is referenced by the Director, this device can automatically be selected. If this directive is set to no, then the Device can only be referenced by directly using the Device name in the Director. This is useful for reserving a drive for something special such as a high priority backup or restore operations.

It is possible to temporarily set this directive using the console command :ref:`setdevice <bcommandSetdevice>`.
