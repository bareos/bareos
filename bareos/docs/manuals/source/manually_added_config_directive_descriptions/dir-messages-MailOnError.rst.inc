Send the message to the email addresses that are given as a comma separated list (without any space) in the address field if the Job terminates with an error condition. :strong:`Mail On Error`\  messages are grouped together during a job and then sent as a single email message when the job terminates. This destination differs from the mail destination in that if the Job terminates normally, the message is totally discarded (for this destination). If the Job terminates in error, it is emailed. By
using other destinations such as append you can ensure that even if the Job terminates normally, the output information is saved.
