This directive defines to which pool the Volume will be placed (moved) when it is recycled. Without this directive, a Volume will remain in the same pool when it is recycled. With this directive, it can be moved automatically to any existing pool during a recycle. This directive is probably most useful when defined in the Scratch pool, so that volumes will be recycled back into the Scratch pool. For more on the see the :ref:`Scratch Pool <TheScratchPool>` section of this manual.

Although this directive is called RecyclePool, the Volume in question is actually moved from its current pool to the one you specify on this directive when Bareos prunes the Volume and discovers that there are no records left in the catalog and hence marks it as Purged.
