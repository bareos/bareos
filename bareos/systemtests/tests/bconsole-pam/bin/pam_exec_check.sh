# auth optional pam_exec.so expose_authtok debug log=/tmp/pam.log /usr/bin/sc_pam_wlan.sh

# called by:
# auth    optional     pam_exec.so expose_authtok /usr/bin/sc_pam_wlan.sh

# pam_exec options:
#   debug
#   expose_authtok
#     During authentication the calling command can read the password from stdin(3).
#     (PAM_TYPE=auth only)
#   log=file
#     The output of the command is appended to file
#   type=type
#     Only run the command if the module type matches the given type.
#   stdout
#     Per default the output of the executed command is written to /dev/null.
#     With this option, the stdout output of the executed command is redirected
#     to the calling application.
#     It's in the responsibility of this application what happens with the output.
#     The log option is ignored.
#  quiet
#    Per default pam_exec.so will echo the exit status of the external command
#    if it fails. Specifying this option will suppress the message.
#  seteuid
#    Per default pam_exec.so will execute the external command
#    with the real user ID of the calling process.
#    Specifying this option means the command is run with the effective user ID.

# PAM_TYPE:
#   "auth"
