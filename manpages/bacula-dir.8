.SH TCP-WRAPPERS CONFIGURATION
Tcpwrappers looks for the service name of the bacula daemons in
.I hosts.allow
, and the service names of these daemons is configured to be different from the
binary.
The service names are configured to be
.B %hostname%-%component%
rather than
.B bacula-dir
(As defined in the bacula-dir.conf.in file)


So the hosts.allow entry has to match
.B %hostname%-%component%
(servername-dir for example) instead of bacula-%component%

.B WARNING:
This means that if the hosts.allow file has the entry:

.B bacula-dir: ALL

you will not be able to run bconsole to connect to the local director!

The entry would have to read:

.B server-dir: ALL

and this will allow the console to connect to the director.
(The process running is bacula-dir.)
