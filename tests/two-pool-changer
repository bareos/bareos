# This is Arno's test.  It uses two pools, two tapes, and
#  an autochanger. Note, the Director has three Pools in its
#  conf:  Default, Full, and Inc.  Default is used in the
#  NightlySave job by default.  What is backed up is what
#  is in ${cwd}/tmp/file-list, which is by default the Bareos
#  source code (i.e. the build directory).
