   This file is used to foul Sphinx and add genindex to the Index.
   Background:
   The index is generated by Sphinx and made available as genindex.
   You can refer to it by 
   
   :ref:`genindex`
   
   However, you can't add an entry for this into the toctree.
   Therefore this fake file is created and included to the toctree.

.. _genindex:
