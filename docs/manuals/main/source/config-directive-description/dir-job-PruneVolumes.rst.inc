Normally, pruning of Volumes from the Catalog is specified on a Pool by Pool basis in :config:option:`dir/pool/AutoPrune`\  directive. Note, this is different from File and Job pruning which is done on a Client by Client basis. If this directive is specified and the value is :strong:`yes`, it will override the value specified in the Pool resource.
