Using different IP Adresses for SD – FD Communication
=====================================================

.. index::
   single: Lan Address


Bareos supports network topologies where the |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| are situated inside of a LAN, but the |bareosDir| is outside of that LAN in the Internet and accesses the |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| via SNAT / port forwarding.

Consider the following scheme:



    
.. code-block:: sh
    :caption: 

       /-------------------\
       |                   |    LAN 10.0.0.1/24
       |                   |
       |  FD_LAN   SD_LAN  |
       |  .10         .20  |
       |                   |
       \___________________/
                 |
             NAT Firewall
             FD: 8.8.8.10 -> 10.0.0.10
             SD: 8.8.8.20 -> 10.0.0.20
                 |
       /-------------------\
       |                   |
       |                   |     WAN / Internet
       |        DIR        |
       |     8.8.8.100     |
       |                   |
       | FD_WAN   SD_WAN   |
       | .30         .40   |
       \___________________/

The |bareosDir| can access the :strong:`FD_LAN` via the IP 8.8.8.10, which is forwarded to the IP 10.0.0.10 inside of the LAN.

The |bareosDir| can access the :strong:`SD_LAN` via the IP 8.8.8.20 which is forwarded to the IP 10.0.0.20 inside of the LAN.

There is also a |bareosFd| and a |bareosSd| outside of the LAN, which have the IPs 8.8.8.30 and 8.8.8.40

All resources are configured so that the :strong:`Address` directive gets the address where the |bareosDir| can reach the daemons.

Additionally, devices being in the LAN get the LAN address configured in the :strong:`Lan Address` directive. The configuration looks as follows:



    
.. code-block:: sh
    :caption: bareos-dir client FD\_LAN

    Client {
       Name = FD_LAN
       Address = 8.8.8.10
       LanAddress = 10.0.0.10
       ...
    }



    
.. code-block:: sh
    :caption: bareos-dir client SD\_LAN

    Storage {
       Name = SD_LAN
       Address = 8.8.8.20
       LanAddress = 10.0.0.20
       ...
    }



    
.. code-block:: sh
    :caption: bareos-dir client FD\_WAN

    Client {
       Name = FD_WAN
       Address = 8.8.8.30
       ...
    }



    
.. code-block:: sh
    :caption: bareos-dir client SD\_WAN

    Storage {
       Name = SD_WAN
       Address = 8.8.8.40
       ...
    }

This way, backups and restores from each |bareosFd| using each |bareosSd| are possible as long as the firewall allows the needed network connections.

The |bareosDir| simply checks if both the involved |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| both have a :strong:`Lan Address` (**Lan Address**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`  and **Lan Address**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage` ) configured.

In that case, the initiating daemon is ordered to connect to the :strong:`Lan Address` instead of the :strong:`Address`. In active client mode, the |bareosFd| connects to the |bareosSd|, in passive client mode (see :ref:`PassiveClient`) the |bareosSd| connects to the |bareosFd|.

If only one or none of the involved |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| have a :strong:`Lan Address` configured, the :strong:`Address` is used as connection target for the initiating daemon.
