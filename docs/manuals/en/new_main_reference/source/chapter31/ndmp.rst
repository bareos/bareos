NDMP Backups with Bareos
========================

:index:`[TAG=NDMP->Overview] <pair: NDMP; Overview>`

NDMP Basics
-----------

NDMP

-  is the abbreviation for Network Data Management Protocol.

-  is a protocol that transports data between Network Attached Storages (NAS) and backup devices.

-  is widely used by storage product vendors and OS vendors like NetApp, Isilon, EMC, Oracle.

-  information is available at http://www.ndmp.org/.

-  version is currently (2016) NDMP Version 4.

-  uses TCP/IP and XDR (External Data Representation) for the communication.

The Bareos NDMP implementation is based on the NDMJOB NDMP reference implementation of Traakan, Inc., Los Altos, CA which has a BSD style license (2 clause one) with some enhancements.

In NDMP, there are different components (called :emphasis:`agents`) involved in doing backups. The most important agents are:

Data Management Agent (DMA)
   is the part that controls the NDMP backup or recover operation.

Data Agent
   (or Primary Storage System) is the part that reads the data from the Filesystem during Backup and writes data to the Filesystem during recover.

Tape Agent
   (or Secondary Storage System) is the part that writes NDMP blocks to the Tape during backup and reads them during recover.

Robot Agent
   is the part that controls the media changer. It loads/unloads tapes and gets the inventory of the Changer. The use of a robot agent is optional. It is possible to run backups on a single tape drive.

All elements involved talk to each other via the NDMP protocol which is usually transported via TCP/IP port 10000.

The Data Management Agent is part of the Backup Application.

The Data Agent is part of the (NAS)-System being backed up and recovered.

The Tape Agent and Robot Agent can

-  run on the system being backed up

-  run as part of the backup application

-  or even run independently on a third system

This flexibility leads to different topologies how NDMP backups can be done.

NDMP Topologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When looking at the different topologies, the location of the Robot Agent is not specially considered, as the data needed to control the robot is minimal compared to the backup data.

So the parts considered are

-  the Data Management Agent controlling the operation

-  the Data Agent as source of the backup data and

-  the Tape Agent as destination of the backup data

The Data Management Agent always controls both Data Agent and Tape Agent over the Network via NDMP.

The Tape Agent can either

-  run on a separate system

-  run on the same system

as the Data Agent.

The data path consists of three ways

-  From Disk to Data Agent (1)

-  From Data Agent over the Network to the Tape Agent (2)

-  From Tape Agent to the Tape (3)

and is called NDMP 3-way Backup.

NDMP 2-way Backup: Data Agent and Tape Agent running on the same system

                                \----------/

Data Agent and Tape Agent are both part of the same process on the system, so the data path consists of two ways:

-  From Disk to Data Agent (1)

-  From Tape Agent to the Tape (2)

and is called NDMP 2-way Backup, also sometimes referred as NDMP local backup.

Properties of the different NDMP Backup topologies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NDMP 3-way backup:

-  The data can be send to a different location over the network

-  No need to attach a tape drive to the NAS system.

-  The backup speed is usually slower than with 2-way backup as the data is being sent over the network and processed multiple times.

NDMP 2-way backup:

-  The data is directly copied from the NAS system to the Tape

-  Usually the fastest way to do a NDMP backup

-  tape drives need to be attached to the NAS System

NDMP Backup in Bareos
---------------------

Bareos offers two types of NDMP integration:

NDMP_NATIVE
NDMP_BAREOS

In both cases,

-  |bareosDir| acts as Data Management Agent.

-  The Data Agent is part of the storage system and must be provided by the storage vendor.

The main difference is which Tape Agent is used.

When using NDMP_BAREOS, the |bareosSd| acts as Tape Agent.

When using NDMP_NATIVE, the Tape Agent must be provided by some other systems. Some storage vendors provide it with there storages, or offer it as an option, e.g. Isilon with their :emphasis:`Isilon Backup Accelerator`.

NDMP_BAREOS
-----------

Bareos implements the Data Management Agent inside of the |bareosDir| and a Tape Agent in the |bareosSd|.

The Tape Agent in the |bareosSd| emulates a NDMP tape drive that has an infinite tape. Because of the infinite tape, no Robot Agent is required and therefore not implemented. The blocks being written to the NDMP tape are wrapped into a normal Bareos backup stream and then stored into the volumes managed by Bareos.

There is always a pair of storage resource definitions:

-  a conventional Bareos storage resource and

-  a NDMP storage resource

These two are linked together. Data that is received by the Tape Agent inside of the |bareosSd| is then stored as Bareos backup stream inside of the paired conventional Bareos storage resource.

On restore, the data is read by the conventional resource, and then recovered as NDMP stream from the NDMP resource.

Example Setup for NDMP_BAREOS backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`[TAG=NDMP->Example->NDMP\_BAREOS] <triple: NDMP; Example; NDMP\_BAREOS>`

This example starts from a clean default Bareos installation.

Enable NDMP on your storage appliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The storage appliance needs to be configured to allow NDMP connections. Therefore usually the NDMP service needs to be enabled and configured with a username and password.

Bareos Director: Configure NDMP Client Resource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add a Client resource to the |bareosDir| configuration and configure it to access your NDMP storage system (Primary Storage System/Data Agent).

-  **Protocol**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\  must be either NDMPv2, NDMPv3 or NDMPv4.

-  **Port**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\  is set to the NDMP Port (usually 10000).

-  **Username**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\  and **Password**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\  are used for the authentication against the NDMP Storage System.

-  **Auth Type**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\  is either Cleartext or MD5. NDMP supports both.

In our example we connect to a Isilon storage appliance emulator:

.. code-block:: sh

   Client {
     Name = ndmp-client
     Address = isilon.example.com
     Port = 10000            # Default port for NDMP
     Protocol = NDMPv4       # Need to specify protocol before password as protocol determines password encoding used
     Auth Type = Clear       # Cleartext Authentication
     Username = "ndmpadmin"  # username of the NDMP user on the DATA AGENT e.g. storage box being backuped.
     Password = "secret"     # password of the NDMP user on the DATA AGENT e.g. storage box being backuped.
   }

Verify, that you can access your Primary Storage System via Bareos:

Bareos Storage Daemon: Configure NDMP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enabling NDMP
'''''''''''''

To enable the NDMP Tape Agent inside of the |bareosSd|, set **NDMP Enable**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`\ =yes:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: enable NDMP in |bareosSd|

   #
   # Default SD config block: enable the NDMP protocol,
   # otherwise it won't listen on port 10000.
   #
   Storage {
      Name = ....
      ...
      NDMP Enable = yes
   }

Add a NDMP resource
'''''''''''''''''''

Additionally, we need to define the access credentials for our NDMP TAPE AGENT (Secondary Storage) inside of this Storage Daemon.

These are configured by adding a NDMP resource to :file:`bareos-sd.conf`:

.. code-block:: sh

   #
   # This resource gives the DMA in the Director access to the Bareos SD via the NDMP protocol.
   # This option is used via the NDMP protocol to open the right TAPE AGENT connection to your
   # Bareos SD via the NDMP protocol. The initialization of the SD is done via the native protocol
   # and is handled via the PairedStorage keyword.
   #
   Ndmp {
     Name = bareos-dir-isilon
     Username = ndmpadmin
     Password = test
     AuthType = Clear
   }

Username and Password can be anything, but they will have to match the settings in the |bareosDir| NDMP Storage resource we configure next.

Now restart the |bareosSd|. If everything is correct, the |bareosSd| starts and listens now on the usual port (9103) and additionally on port 10000 (ndmp).

.. code-block:: sh

   <command>netstat</command> <parameter>-lntp | grep bareos-sd</parameter>
   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9103            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      10661/bareos-sd
   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:10000           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      10661/bareos-sd

Bareos Director: Configure a Paired Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For NDMP Backups, we always need two storages that are paired together. The default configuration already has a Storage **File**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`  defined:

.. code-block:: sh

   Storage {
     Name = File
     Address = bareos
     Password = "pNZ3TvFAL/t+MyOIQo58p5B/oB79SFncdAmLXKHa9U59"
     Device = FileStorage
     Media Type = File
   }

We now add a paired storage to the already existing **File**:sup:`Dir`:sub:``  storage:

.. code-block:: sh

   #
   # Same storage daemon but via NDMP protocol.
   # We link via the PairedStorage config option the Bareos SD
   # instance definition to a NDMP TAPE AGENT.
   #
   Storage {
     Name = NDMPFile
     Address = bareos
     Port = 10000
     Protocol = NDMPv4
     Auth Type = Clear
     Username = ndmpadmin
     Password = "test"
     Device = FileStorage
     Media Type = File
     PairedStorage = File
   }

The settings of Username and Password need to match the settings of the |bareosSd|’s NDMP resource we added before. The address will be used by the storage appliance’s NDMP Daemon to connect to the |bareosSd| via NDMP. Make sure that the Storage appliance can resolve the name or use an IP address.

Now save the director resource and restart the |bareosDir|. Verify that the configuration is correct:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: verify connection to the |bareosSd|

   *<input>status storage=NDMPFile</input>

The output looks the same, as if a :strong:`status storage=File` would have been called.

.. _section-NdmpFileset:

Bareos Director: Configure NDMP Fileset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To specify what files and directories from the storage appliance should be backed up, a Fileset needs to be specified. In our example, we decided to backup :file:`/ifs/home` directory.

The specified directory needs to be a filesystem or a subdirectory of a filesystem which can be accessed by NDMP. Which filesystems are available is showed in the :strong:`status client` output of the NDMP client.

:index:`[TAG=NDMP->Environment variables] <pair: NDMP; Environment variables>` Additionally, NDMP can be configured via NDMP environment variables. These can be specified in the Options Block of the Fileset with the :strong:`Meta` keyword. Which variables are available is partly depending on the NDMP implementation of the Storage Appliance.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: NDMP Fileset

   Fileset {
     Name = "NDMP Fileset"
     Include {
       Options {
           meta = "BUTYPE=DUMP"
           meta = "USE_TBB_IF_AVAILABLE=y"
           meta = "FH_REPORT_FULL_DIRENTS=y"
           meta = "RESTORE_HARDLINK_BY_TABLE=y"
       }
       File = /ifs/home
     }
   }



.. warning::
   Normally (**Protocol**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\ =Native) Filesets get handled by the \bareosFd. When connecting directly to a NDMP Clients (**Protocol**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\ =NDMP*), no |bareosFd| is involved and therefore most Fileset options can't be used. Instead, parameters are handled via :strong:`Options - Meta` from **Include**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`\ .



.. warning::
   Avoid using multiple **Include**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`\  :strong:`File` directives.
   The |bareosDir| would try to handle them by running multiple NDMP jobs in a single Bareos job.
   Even if this is working fine during backup, restore jobs will cause trouble.

Some NDMP environment variables are set automatically by the DMA in the |bareosDir|. The following environment variables are currently set automatically:

FILESYSTEM
   is set to the **Include**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`\  :strong:`File` directive.

HIST
   | = Y
   | Specifies the file history format:

   Y
      Specifies the default file history format determined by your NDMP backup settings.

   N
      Disables file history. Without file hostory, single file restore is not possible with Bareos.

   Some NDMP environments (eg. Isilon OneFS) allow additional parameter:

   F
      Specifies path-based file history. This is the most efficient with Bareos.

   D
      Specifies directory or node file history.

LEVEL
   is set accordingly to :ref:`section-NdmpBackupLevel`.

PREFIX
TYPE
   is set accordingly to BUTYPE. Default :emphasis:`DUMP`.

UPDATE
   = Y

Example NDMP Fileset to backup a subset of a NDMP filesystem
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The following fileset is intended to backup all files and directories matching :file:`/ifs/home/users/a*`. It has been tested against Isilon OneFS 7.2.0.1. See `Isilon OneFS 7.2.0 CLI Administration Guide <https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu56048.pdf>`_, section quote{NDMP environment variables} for details about the supported NDMP environment variables. Excludes are not used in this example.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: NDMP Fileset Isilon Include/Exclude

   Fileset {
     Name = "isilon_fileset_home_a"
     Include {
       Options {
           meta = "BUTYPE=DUMP"
           meta = "USE_TBB_IF_AVAILABLE=y"

           #
           # EXCLUDE
           #
           #meta = "EXCLUDE=[b-z]*"

           #

       File = /ifs/home/users
     }
   }

Bareos Director: Configure NDMP Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To do NDMP backups and restores, some special settings need to be configured. We define special Backup and Restore jobs for NDMP.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: NDMP backup job

   Job {
     Name          = "ndmp-backup-job"
     Type          = Backup
     Protocol      = NDMP_BAREOS
     Level         = Incremental
     Client        = ndmp-client
     Backup Format = dump
     FileSet       = "NDMP Fileset"
     Storage       = NDMPFile
     Pool          = Full
     Messages      = Standard
   }

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: NDMP restore job

   Job {
     Name          = "ndmp-restore-job"
     Type          = Restore
     Protocol      = NDMP_BAREOS
     Client        = ndmp-client
     Backup Format = dump
     FileSet       = "NDMP Fileset"
     Storage       = NDMPFile
     Pool          = Full
     Messages      = Standard
     Where         = /
   }

-  **Backup Format**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Job`\ =dump is used in our example. Other Backup Formats have other advantages/disadvantages.

We have successfully created our first NDMP backup.

Let us have a look what files are in our backup:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: list the files of the backup job

   *<input>list files jobid=1</input>
    /@NDMP/ifs/home%0
    /ifs/home/
    /ifs/home/admin/
    /ifs/home/admin/.zshrc

The real backup data is stored in the file :file:`/@NDMP/ifs/home%0` (we will refer to it as :emphasis:`NDMP main backup file` or :emphasis:`main backup file` later on). One NDMP main backup file is created for every directory specified in the used Fileset. The other files show the file history and are hardlinks to the backup file.

Run NDMP Restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have a NDMP backup, we of course also want to restore some data from the backup. If the backup we just did saved the Filehistory, we are able to select single files for restore. Otherwise, we will only be able to restore the whole backup.

Full Restore
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Either select all files or the main backup file (:file:`/@NDMP/ifs/home%0`). If file history is not included in the backup job, than only the main backup file is available.

Restore files to original path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: sh

   *<input>restore jobid=1</input>
   You have selected the following JobId: 1

   Building directory tree for JobId(s) 1 ...
   2 files inserted into the tree.

   You are now entering file selection mode where you add (mark) and
   remove (unmark) files to be restored. No files are initially added, unless
   you used the "all" keyword on the command line.
   Enter "done" to leave this mode.

   cwd is: /

Restore files to different path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The restore location is determined by the **Where**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Job`\  setting of the restore job. In NDMP, this parameter works in a special manner, the prefix can be either :emphasis:`relative` to the filesystem or :emphasis:`absolute`. If a prefix is set in form of a directory (like :file:`/bareos-restores`), it will be a relative prefix and will be added between the filesystem and the filename. This is needed to make sure that the
data is restored in a different directory, but into the same filesystem. If the prefix is set with a leading caret (^), it will be an absolute prefix and will be put at the front of the restore path. This is needed if the restored data should be stored into a different filesystem.

Example:

# Tabular in LaTex format (original)

::

   \begin{tabular}{l | l | l}
   \hline
   original file name &  where &  restored file \\
   \hline
   :file:`/ifs/home/admin/.zshrc` & :file:`/bareos-restores`           & :file:`/ifs/home/bareos-restores/admin/.zshrc` \\
   :file:`/ifs/home/admin/.zshrc` & \textasciicircum\verb|path:/ifs/data/bareos-restores| & :file:`/ifs/data/bareos-restores/admin/.zshrc` \\
   \hline

NDMP Copy Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`[TAG=Copy->NDMP] <pair: Copy; NDMP>` :index:`[TAG=NDMP->Copy jobs] <pair: NDMP; Copy jobs>`

To be able to do copy jobs, we need to have a second storage resource where we can copy the data to. Depending on your requirements, this resource can be added to the existing |bareosSd| (e.g. **autochanger-0**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`  for tape based backups) or to an additional |bareosSd|.

We set up an additional |bareosSd| on a host named :strong:`bareos-sd2.example.com` with the default **FileStorage**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`  device.

When this is done, add a second storage resource **File2**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`  to the :file:`bareos-dir.conf`:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: Storage resource File2

   Storage {
     Name = File2
     Address = bareos-sd2.example.com
     Password = <secretpassword>
     Device = FileStorage
     Media Type = File
   }

Copy Jobs copy data from one pool to another (see :ref:`MigrationChapter`). So we need to define a pool where the copies will be written to:

Add a Pool that the copies will run to:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: Pool resource Copy

   #
   # Copy Destination Pool
   #
   Pool {
     Name = Copy
     Pool Type = Backup
     Recycle = yes                       # Bareos can automatically recycle Volumes
     AutoPrune = yes                     # Prune expired volumes
     Volume Retention = 365 days         # How long should the Full Backups be kept? (#06)
     Maximum Volume Bytes = 50G          # Limit Volume size to something reasonable
     Maximum Volumes = 100               # Limit number of Volumes in Pool
     Label Format = "Copy-"              # Volumes will be labeled "Full-<volume-id>"
     Storage = File2                     # Pool belongs to Storage File2
   }

Then we need to define the just defined pool as the **Next Pool**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Pool`\  of the pool that actually holds the data to be copied.

In our case this is the **Full**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Pool`  Pool:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: add Next Pool setting

   #
   # Full Pool definition
   #
   Pool {
     Name = Full
     [...]
     Next Pool = Copy   # <- this line needs to be added!
   }

Finally, we need to define a Copy Job that will select the jobs that are in the **Full**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Pool`  pool and copy them over to the **Copy**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Pool`  pool reading the data via the **File**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`  Storage and writing the data via the **File2**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`  Storage:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: NDMP copy job

   Job {
      Name = NDMPCopy
      Type = Copy
      Messages = Standard
      Selection Type = PoolUncopiedJobs
      Pool = Full
      Storage = NDMPFile
   }

After restarting the director and storage daemon, we can run the Copy job:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: run copy job

   *<input>run job=NDMPCopy</input>
   Run Copy job
   JobName:       NDMPCopy
   Bootstrap:     *None*
   Pool:          Full (From Job resource)

.. warning::
   :strong:`list jobs` will only show the number of main backup files as JobFiles. However, with :strong:`list files jobid=...` all files are visible.

Restore to NDMP Primary Storage System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unfortunately, we are not able to restore the copied data to our NDMP storage. If we try we get this message:

.. code-block:: sh

   21-Jan 09:21 bareos-dir JobId 77: Fatal error: Read storage File2 doesn't point to storage definition with paired storage option.

To be able to do NDMP operations from the storage that was used to store the copies, we need to define a NDMP storage that is paired with it. The definition is very similar to our **NDMPFile**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`  Storage, as we want to restore the data to the same NDMP Storage system:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: add paired Storage resource for File2

   Storage {
     Name = NDMPFile2
     Address = bareos-sd2.example.com
     Port = 10000
     Protocol = NDMPv4
     Auth Type = Clear
     Username = ndmpadmin
     Password = "test"
     Device = FileStorage2
     Media Type = File
     PairedStorage = File2
   }

Also we have to configure NDMP on the |bareosSd| :strong:`bareos-sd2.example.com`. For this follow the instruction from :ref:`section-ndmp-sd-configure`.

After this, a restore from :strong:`bareos-sd2.example.com` directly to the NDMP Primary Storage System is possible.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

This list the specific limitiations of the NDMP_BAREOS protocol. For limitation for all Bareos NDMP implementation, see :ref:`section-NdmpCommonLimitations`.

.. _section-ndmp-filehistory:

NDMP Job limitations when scanning in volumes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`[TAG=NDMP->File History] <pair: NDMP; File History>`

For NDMP jobs, all data is stored into a single big file. The file and directory information (File History in NDMP Terms) is stored as hardlinks to this big file.

:index:`NDMP: File information are not available in the Bareos backup stream. <triple: Limitation; NDMP; File information are not available in the Bareos backup stream>`
   As hardlink information is only stored in the Bareos database, but not int the backup stream itself, it is not possible to recover the file history information from the NDMP stream with :command:`bscan`.

   As storing the database dump for disaster recovery and storing the bootstrap file offsite is recommended  anyway (see :ref:`section-before-disaster`), this should be not a big problem in correctly setup environments.

   For the same reason, the information about the number of files of a job (e.g. JobFiles with :strong:`list jobs` command) is limited to the number of NDMP backup files in copied jobs.
   


Restore always transfers the full main backup file to the Primary Storage System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contrary to :ref:`NDMP_NATIVE <section-NdmpNative>`, the :ref:`NDMP_BAREOS <section-NdmpBareos>` implementation do not support NDMP :emphasis:`Direct Access Restore` (DAR).

On restore, the full main backup file (:file:`@NDMP/...%.`) is always transfered back to the Primary Storage System, together with a description, what files to restore.

The reason for this is that the Primary Storage System handles the backup data by itself. Bareos will not modify the backup data it receives from the Primary Storage System.

.. _section-NdmpNative:

NDMP_NATIVE
-----------

The NDMP_NATIVE protocol is implemented since Bareos :index:`Version >= 17.2.3 <pair: bareos-17.2.3; NDMP NATIVE>`.

Bareos implements the Data Management Agent inside of the |bareosDir| and is the only Bareos Daemon involved in the backups.

When using NDMP_NATIVE, the Tape Agent must be provided by some other systems. Some storage vendors provide it with there storages, or offer it as an option, e.g. Isilon with there :emphasis:`Isilon Backup Accelerator`.

Example Setup for NDMP_NATIVE backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`[TAG=NDMP->Example->NDMP\_NATIVE] <triple: NDMP; Example; NDMP\_NATIVE>`

Configure a NDMP Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This defines the connection to the NDMP Data Agent.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Client/isilon.conf

   Client {
     Name = isilon
     Address = isilon.example.com
     Port = 10000
     Protocol = NDMPv4
     Auth Type = MD5
     Username = "ndmpadmin"
     Password = "secret"
     Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
   }

Verify, that you can access your Primary Storage System (Tape Agent) via Bareos:

.. code-block:: sh

Configure a NDMP Fileset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This determines what filesystem to backup and configures the NDMP environment to use in the meta options for it.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Fileset/isilon.conf

   Fileset {
       Name = "isilon"
       Include {
           Options {
               meta = "HIST=F"
               meta = "DIRECT=Y"
               meta = "RECURSIVE=Y"
               meta = "BUTYPE=DUMP"
           }
       File = /ifs/home
       }
   }

The setting of :strong:`"DIRECT = Y"` is required for Direct Access Recovery.

For more information, see :ref:`section-NdmpFileset`.

Configure a NDMP Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This defines now to connect to the Tape and Robot Agents and what devices to use.

As we do not yet now the device names, we can put a placeholder string in **Device**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`\  and **NDMP Changer Device**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`\ :

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Storage/isilon.conf

   Storage {
     Name = isilon
     Address = isilon.example.com
     Port = 10000
     Protocol = NDMPv4
     Auth Type = MD5
     Username = "ndmpadmin"
     Password = "secret"
     Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
     Autochanger = yes
     MediaType = NDMP-Tape

     Device = unknown               # use "status storage" to determine the tape device
     NDMP Changer Device = unknown  # use "status storage" to determine the changer device
   }

Verify that the connection to the NDMP Tape Agent and Robot Agent work, by running the :strong:`status storage` command.

The Tape Agent will return information about the available tape drives. The Robot Agent will return information about the available tape changer device.

The interesting parts of the output is the device information both of the Tape Agent and Robot Agent.

As each NDMP backup or recovery operation always involves exactly one tape and at one robot agent.

We now know the device names and can configure what robot and what tape to use when this storage is used by bareos by updating the **isilon**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`  resource:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Storage/isilon.conf

   Storage {
     Name = isilon
     Address = isilon.example.com
     Port = 10000
     Protocol = NDMPv4
     Auth Type = MD5
     Username = "ndmpadmin"
     Password = "secret"
     Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
     Autochanger = yes
     MediaType = NDMP-Tape

     Device = HP-TLD-004-01
     NDMP Changer Device = mc001
   }

Configure a Pool for the NDMP Tapes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Pool/NDMP-Tape.conf

   Pool {
     Name = NDMP-Tape
     Pool Type = Backup
     Recycle = yes                       # Bareos can automatically recycle Volumes
     Auto Prune = yes                    # Prune expired volumes
     Volume Retention = 365 days         # How long should the Full Backups be kept?
   }

Configure NDMP Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be able to do scheduled backups, we need to configure a backup job that will use the NDMP client and NDMP storage resources:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Job/ndmp-native-backup-job.conf

   Job {
      Name = ndmp-native-backup-job
      type = backup
      protocol = NDMP_NATIVE
      level = incremental
      client = isilon
      storage = isilon
      backup format = dump
      messages = Standard
      Pool = NDMP-Tape
      save file history = yes
      FileSet = isilon
   }

As we also need to be able to do a restore of the backuped data, we also need to define an adequate restore job:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/Job/ndmp-native-restore-job.conf

   Job{
      Name = ndmp-restore
      type = restore
      protocol = NDMP_NATIVE
      client = isilon
      backup format = dump
      fileset = isilon
      storage  = isilon
      pool = NDMP-Tape
      Messages = Standard
      where = /
   }

Label Tapes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we can really start do do backups, first we need to label the tapes that should be used.

First we check if our robot has tapes with barcodes by running status slots:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: status storage=isilon slots

   *<input>status slots</input>
    Slot |   Volume Name    |   Status  |  Media Type    |         Pool             |
   ------+------------------+-----------+----------------+--------------------------|
       1@|                ? |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
       2@|                ? |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
       3@|                ? |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
       4@|                ? |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
   [...]
     251*|           BT0001 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
     252*|           BT0002 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
     253*|           BT0003 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
     254*|           BT0004 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
     255*|           BT0005 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
     256*|           BT0006 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
     257*|           BT0007 |         ? |              ? |                        ? |
   [...]

Now we can label these tapes and add them to the pool that we have created for NDMP Tapes:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: label barcodes

   *<input>label storage=isilon barcodes slots=251-257</input>
   Automatically selected Storage: isilon
   Select Drive:
        1: Drive 0
        2: Drive 1
   Select drive (1-12): 1
   get ndmp_vol_list...
   The following Volumes will be labeled:
   Slot  Volume
   ==============
    251  BT0001
    252  BT0002
    253  BT0003
    254  BT0004
    255  BT0005
    256  BT0006
    257  BT0007
   Do you want to label these Volumes? (yes|no): yes
   Defined Pools:
        1: Scratch
        2: NDMP-Tape
        3: Incremental
        4: Full
        5: Differential
   Select the Pool (1-5): 2
   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0001 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0
   Catalog record for Volume "BT0001", Slot 251 successfully created.
   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0002 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0
   Catalog record for Volume "BT0002", Slot 252 successfully created.
   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0003 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0

   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0004 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0
   Catalog record for Volume "BT0004", Slot 254 successfully created.
   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0005 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0
   Catalog record for Volume "BT0005", Slot 255 successfully created.
   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0006 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0
   Catalog record for Volume "BT0006", Slot 256 successfully created.
   ndmp_send_label_request: VolumeName=BT0007 MediaType=NDMP-Tape PoolName=NDMP-Tape drive=0
   Catalog record for Volume "BT0007", Slot 257 successfully created.

We have now 7 volumes in our NDMP-Tape Pool that were labeled and can be used for NDMP Backups.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`NDMP\_NATIVE: Only use the first tape drive will be used. <triple: Limitation; NDMP\_NATIVE; Only use the first tape drive will be used>`
   A NDMP job only uses a single tape drive. Currently, a Bareos job always uses the first defined tape drive of the \TapeAgent.


NDMP Common
-----------

This section contains additional information about the Bareos NDMP implementation that are valid for all Bareos NDMP protocols.

.. _section-NdmpBackupLevel:

NDMP Backup Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`[TAG=NDMP->Level] <pair: NDMP; Level>`

The trailing number in the main backup file (after the :file:`%` character) indicates the NDMP backup level:

# Tabular in LaTex format (original)

::

   \begin{tabular}{c | l}
   \hline
   Level & Description \\
   \hline
   0 & Full NDMP backup. \\
   1 & Differential or first Incremental backup.\\
   2-9 & second to ninth Incremental backup.\\
   \hline
   \end{tabular}

# Tabular converted from LaTeX to RST (or empty, in case of problems):

===== =========================================
Level Description
===== =========================================
0     Full NDMP backup.
1     Differential or first Incremental backup.
2-9   second to ninth Incremental backup.
===== =========================================

Differential Backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

are supported. The NDMP backup level will be 1, visible as trailing number in the backup file (:file:`/@NDMP/ifs/home%1`).

Incremental Backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

are supported. The NDMP backup level will increment with each run, until a Full (0) or Differential (1) will be made. The maximum backup level will be 9. Additional Incremental backups will result in a failed job and the message:

.. code-block:: sh

    2016-01-21 13:35:51 bareos-dir JobId 12: Fatal error: NDMP dump format doesn't support more than 8 incrementals, please run a Differential or a Full Backup

NDMP Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To debug the NDMP backups, these settings can be adapted:

-  

   **NDMP Snooping**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Director`\ 

-  

   **NDMP Log Level**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Director`\ 

-  

   **NDMP Log Level**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\ 

-  

   **NDMP Snooping**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`\ 

-  

   **NDMP Log Level**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`\ 

This will create a lot of debugging output that will help to find the problem during NDMP backups.

.. _section-NdmpCommonLimitations:

Bareos NDMP Common Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NDMP Fileset limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`NDMP: A NDMP fileset should only contain a single File directive and Meta options. <triple: Limitation; NDMP; A NDMP fileset should only contain a single File directive and Meta options>`
   Using multiple **Include**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`\  :strong:`File` directives should be avoided.
   The |bareosDir| would try to handle them by running multiple NDMP jobs in a single Bareos job.
   Even if this is working fine during backup, restore jobs will cause trouble.

   Normally (**Protocol**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\ =Native) Filesets get handled by the \bareosFd. When connecting directly to a NDMP Clients (**Protocol**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\ =NDMP*), no |bareosFd| is involved and therefore most Fileset options can't be used. Instead, parameters are handled via :strong:`Options - Meta` from **Include**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`\ .
   


Single file restore on incremental backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`NDMP: No single file restore on merged backups. <triple: Limitation; NDMP; No single file restore on merged backups>`
   Unfortunately, it is currently (bareos-15.2.2) not possible to restore a chain of Full and Incremental backups at once.
   The workaround for that problem is to restore the full backup and each incremental each in a single restore operation.
   


Temporary memory mapped database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`NDMP: 64-bit system recommended. <triple: Limitation; NDMP; 64-bit system recommended>`
   The |bareosDir| uses a memory mapped database (LMBD) to temporarily store NDMP file information.
   On some 32-bit systems the default **File History Size**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Job`\  requires a larger memory area than available.
   In this case, you either have to lower the **File History Size**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Job`\ 
   or preferably run the |bareosDir| on a 64-bit system.
