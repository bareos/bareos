Bareos Main Reference and Documentation
=======================================

for Bareos version |version| release |release|, created |today|

Welcome to the new Bareos documentation. The documentation is being
converted to the format that you are currently reading.
As the conversion is automated, and there are still some things that are not
perfectly converted, we still have the `old documentation <http://doc.bareos.org>`_ available.


The Information regarding the newest release candidate in the :ref:`bareos-1824rc2-releasenotes`
and in the :ref:`bareos-1824rc2-updatefaq`
