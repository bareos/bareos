Transport Encryption

Bareos TLS (Transport Layer Security) is built-in network encryption code to provide secure network transport similar to that offered by :program:`stunnel` or :program:`ssh`. The data written to Volumes by the Storage daemon is not encrypted by this code. For data encryption, please see the :ref:`DataEncryption` chapter.

The initial Bacula encryption implementation has been written by Landon Fuller.

Supported features of this code include:

-  Client/Server TLS Requirement Negotiation

-  TLSv1 Connections with Server and Client Certificate Validation

-  Forward Secrecy Support via Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Keying

This document will refer to both :emphasis:`server` and :emphasis:`client` contexts. These terms refer to the accepting and initiating peer, respectively.

Diffie-Hellman anonymous ciphers are not supported by this code. The use of DH anonymous ciphers increases the code complexity and places explicit trust upon the two-way CRAM-MD5 implementation. CRAM-MD5 is subject to known plaintext attacks, and it should be considered considerably less secure than PKI certificate-based authentication.

.. _TlsDirectives:

TLS Configuration Directives
----------------------------

Additional configuration directives have been added to all the daemons (Director, File daemon, and Storage daemon) as well as the various different Console programs. These directives are defined as follows:

\begin{description}
   \directive{dir}{TLS Enable}{yes|no}{}{no}{}%
   Enable TLS support. Without setting :strong:`TLS Require`=yes,
   the connection can fall back to unencrypted connection,
   if the other side does not support TLS.

   \directive{dir}{TLS Require}{yes|no}{}{no}{}%
   Require TLS connections.
   If TLS is not required,
   then Bareos will connect with other daemons either with or without TLS depending
   on what the other daemon requests.
   If TLS is required,
   then Bareos will refuse any connection that does not use TLS.
   :strong:`TLS Require`=yes  implicitly sets :strong:`TLS Enable`=yes.

   \directive{dir}{TLS Certificate}{filename}{}{}{}%
   The full path and filename of a PEM encoded TLS certificate.  It can be
   used as either a client or server certificate.
   It is used because PEM files are base64 encoded and hence ASCII
   text based rather than binary.
   They may also contain encrypted information.

   \directive{dir}{TLS Key}{filename}{}{}{}%
   The full path and filename of a PEM encoded TLS private key.  It must
   correspond to the certificate specified in the :strong:`TLS Certificate` configuration directive.

   \directive{dir}{TLS Verify Peer}{yes|no}{}{}{}%
   Request and verify the peers certificate.

   In server context, unless the :strong:`TLS Allowed CN` configuration directive is specified,
   any client certificate signed by a known-CA will be accepted.

   In client context, the server certificate CommonName attribute is checked against
   the :strong:`Address` and :strong:`TLS Allowed CN` configuration directives.


   \directive{dir}{TLS Allowed CN}{stringlist}{}{}{}%
   Common name attribute of allowed peer certificates.
   If :strong:`TLS Verify Peer`=yes, all connection request certificates
   will be checked against this list.

   This directive may be specified more than once.


   \directive{dir}{TLS CA Certificate File}{filename}{}{}{}%
   The full path and filename specifying a
   PEM encoded TLS CA certificate(s).  Multiple certificates are
   permitted in the file.

   In a client context, one of
   :strong:`TLS CA Certificate File` or :strong:`TLS CA Certificate Dir`
   is required.

   In a server context, it is only required if :strong:`TLS Verify Peer` is used.

   \directive{dir}{TLS CA Certificate Dir}{directory}{}{}{}%
   Full path to TLS CA certificate directory.  In the current implementation,
   certificates must be stored PEM encoded with OpenSSL-compatible hashes,
   which is the subject name's hash and an extension of {\bf .0}.

   In a client context, one of
   :strong:`TLS CA Certificate File` or :strong:`TLS CA Certificate Dir`
   is required.

   In a server context, it is only required if :strong:`TLS Verify Peer` is used.


   \directive{dir}{TLS DH File}{filename}{}{}{}%
   Path to PEM encoded Diffie-Hellman parameter file.  If this directive is
   specified, DH key exchange will be used for the ephemeral keying, allowing
   for forward secrecy of communications.  DH key exchange adds an additional
   level of security because the key used for encryption/decryption by the
   server and the client is computed on each end and thus is never passed over
   the network if Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used.  Even if DH key
   exchange is not used, the encryption/decryption key is always passed
   encrypted.  This directive is only valid within a server context.

   To generate the parameter file, you
   may use openssl:

   \begin{verbatim}\begin{commands}{create DH key}
   openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem -5 1024
   \end{commands}\end{verbatim}

   \end{description}

Getting TLS Certificates
------------------------

To get a trusted certificate (CA or Certificate Authority signed certificate), you will either need to purchase certificates signed by a commercial CA or become a CA yourself, and thus you can sign all your own certificates.

Bareos is known to work well with RSA certificates.

You can use programs like `xca <http://xca.sourceforge.net/>`_ or TinyCA to easily manage your own CA with a Graphical User Interface.
