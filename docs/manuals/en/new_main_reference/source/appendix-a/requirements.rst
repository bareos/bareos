System Requirements
===================

-  The minimum versions for each of the databases supported by Bareos are:

   -  PostgreSQL 8.4 (since Bareos 13.2.3)

   -  MySQL 4.1 - 5.6 or compatible fork (e.g. MariaDB), see :ref:`section-MysqlSupport`

   -  SQLite 3

-  Windows release is cross-compiled on Linux

-  Bareos requires a good implementation of pthreads to work. This is not the case on some of the BSD systems.

-  The source code has been written with portability in mind and is mostly POSIX compatible. Thus porting to any POSIX compatible operating system should be relatively easy.

-  Jansson library: 

.. _jansson
 :index:`[TAG=JSON] <single: JSON>` :index:`[TAG=Jansson->\see{JSON}] <pair: Jansson; \see{JSON}>` Bareos :index:`Version >= 15.2.0 <triple: bareos-15.2.0; requires; jansson>` offers a JSON API mode, see `Bareos Developer Guide (api-mode-2-json) <http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-developer-guide.html#api-mode-2-json>`_. On some platform, the Jansson library is directory available. On others it can easly be added. For some older platforms, we compile Bareos without JSON API mode.
