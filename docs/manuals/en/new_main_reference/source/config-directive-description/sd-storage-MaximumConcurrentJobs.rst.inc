This directive specifies the maximum number of Jobs that may run concurrently. Each contact from the Director (e.g. status request, job start request) is considered as a Job, so if you want to be able to do a :strong:`status` request in the console at the same time as a Job is running, you will need to set this value greater than 1. To run simultaneous Jobs, you will need to set a number of other directives in the Director’s configuration file. Which ones you set depend on what
you want, but you will almost certainly need to set the :config:option:`dir/storage/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\ . Please refer to the :ref:`ConcurrentJobs` chapter.
