This specifies the name of the catalog resource to be used for this Pool. When a catalog is defined in a Pool it will override the definition in the client (and the Catalog definition in a Job since :index:`Version >= 13.4.0 <pair: bareos-13.4.0; Job catalog overwritten by Pool catalog>`). e.g. this catalog setting takes precedence over any other definition.
