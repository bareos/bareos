================ ===============================================

This release contains several enhancements. Excerpt:

-  Bareos Distribution (packages)

   -  **python-bareos** is included in the core distribution.

   -  **bareos-storage-droplet** is a storage backend for the droplet library. Most notably it allows backup and restores to a S3 environment. \betaSince{sd}{bareos-storage-droplet}{17.2.4}

   -  **bat** has been removed, see section :ref:`bat`.

   -  platforms:

      -  Windows Clients are still supported since Windows Vista.

      -  MacOS: added to build chain.

      -  |bareosFd| is ready for HP-UX 11.31 (ia64).

      -  Linux Distribution: Bareos tries to provide packages for all current platforms. For details, refer to :ref:`section-packages`.

   -  Linux RPM packages: allow read access to /etc/bareos/ for all users (however, relevant files are still only readable for the user **bareos**). This allows other programs associated with Bareos to also use this directory.

-  Denormalization of the **File** database table

   -  The denormalization of the **File** database table leads to enormous performance improvements in installation, which covering a lot of file (millions and more).

   -  For the denormalization the database schema must be modified. 

                   .. warning::
                      Updating the database to schema version >= 2170 will increase the required disk space.
                      Especially it will require around twice the amount of the current database disk space during the migration.

   -  The **Filename** database table does no longer exists. Therefore the :strong:`.bvfs_*` commands do no longer output the \dbcolumn{FilenameId} column.

-  NDMP_NATIVE support has been added. This include the NDMP features DAR and DDAR. For details see :ref:`section-NdmpNative`.

-  Updated the package **bareos-vmware-plugin** to utilize the Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) 6.5.x. This includes support for |vsphere| 6.5 and the next major release (except new features) and backward compatible with |vsphere| 5.5 and 6.0. For details see :ref:`VMwarePlugin`.

-  Soft Quota: automatic quota grace period reset if a job does not exceed the quota.

-  :command:`bareos-dbcheck`: disable all interactive questions in batch mode.

-  :strong:`list files`: also show deleted files (accurate mode).

-  :strong:`list jobstatastics`: added.

-  :strong:`purge`: added confirmation.

-  :strong:`list volumes`: fix limit and offset handling.

-  :issue:`629` Windows: restore directory attributes.

-  :issue:`639` tape: fix block size handling, AWS VTL iSCSI devices

-  :issue:`705` support for MySQL 5.7

-  :issue:`719` allow long JSON messages (has been increased from 100KB to 2GB).

-  :issue:`793` Virtual Backups: skip jobs with no files.

================ ===============================================

This release contains several bugfixes and enhancements. Excerpt:

-  Fixes a Director crash, when enabling debugging output

-  :strong:`.bvfs_lsdirs`: improve performance, especially when having a large number of directories

   -  To optimize the performance of the SQL query used by :strong:`.bvfs_lsdirs`, it is important to have the following indexes:

   -  PostgreSQL

      -  

         \sqlcommand{CREATE INDEX file_jpfnidpart_idx ON File(PathId,JobId,FilenameId) WHERE FileIndex = 0;}

      -  | If the index \sqlcommand{file_jfnidpart_idx} mentioned in 16.2.6 release notes exist, drop it:
         | \sqlcommand{DROP INDEX file_jfnidpart_idx;}

   -  MySQL/MariaDB

      -  

         \sqlcommand{CREATE INDEX PathId_JobId_FileNameId_FileIndex ON File(PathId,JobId,FilenameId,FileIndex);}

      -  | If the index \sqlcommand{PathId_JobId_FileIndex_FileNameId} mentioned in 16.2.6 release notes exist, drop it:
         | \sqlcommand{DROP INDEX PathId_JobId_FileIndex_FileNameId ON File;}

-  Utilize OpenSSL >= 1.1 if available

-  Windows: fixes silent upgrade (:command:`winbareos-*.exe /S`)

-  Windows: restore attributes also on directories (not only on files)

-  Fixes problem with SHA1 signature when compiled without OpenSSL (not relevant for bareos.org/bareos.com packages)

-  Packages for openSUSE Leap 42.3 and Fedora 26 have been added.

-  Packages for AIX and current HP-UX 11.31

Url              `<http://download.bareos.com/bareos/release/16.2/>`_
================ ===============================================

This release contains several bugfixes and enhancements. Excerpt:

-  Prevent from director crash when using incorrect paramaters of :strong:`.bvfs_*` commands.

-  Director now closes all configuration files when reloading failed.

-  Storage daemon now closes the network connection when MaximumConcurrentJobs reached.

-  New directive :strong:`LanAddress` was added to the Client and Storage Resources of the director to facilitate a network topology where client and storage are situated inside of a LAN, but the Director is outside of that LAN. See :ref:`LanAddress` for details.

-  A Problem in the storage abstraction layer was fixed where the director picked the wrong storage daemon when multiple storages/storage daemons were used.

-  The device spool size calculation when using secure erase was fixed.

-  :strong:`.bvfs_lsdirs` no longer shows empty directories from accurate jobs.

   -  

      

.. warning::
   This decreases performance if your environment has a large numbers of directories. Creating an index improves the performance.

   -  

      |postgresql|

      -  | When using PostgreSQL, creating the following partial improves the performance sufficiently:
         | \sqlcommand{CREATE INDEX file_jfnidpart_idx ON File(JobId, FilenameId) WHERE FileIndex = 0;}

      -  | Run following command to create the partial index:
         | :file:`su - postgres -c 'echo "CREATE INDEX file_jfnidpart_idx ON File(JobId, FilenameId) WHERE FileIndex = 0; ANALYZE File;" | psql bareos'`

   -  

      |mysql|

      -  | When using MySQL or MariaDB, creating the following index improves the performance:
         | \sqlcommand{CREATE INDEX PathId_JobId_FileIndex_FileNameId ON File(PathId,JobId,FileIndex,FilenameId);}

      -  | Run following command to create the index:
         | :file:`echo "CREATE INDEX PathId_JobId_FileIndex_FileNameId ON File(PathId,JobId,FileIndex,FilenameId);" | mysql -u root bareos`

      -  However, with larger amounts of directories and/or involved jobs, even with this index the performance of :strong:`.bvfs_lsdirs` may still be insufficient. We are working on optimizing the SQL query for MySQL/MariaDB to solve this problem.

-  Packages for Univention UCS 4.2 have been added.

-  Packages for Debian 9 (Stretch) have been added.

-  WebUI: The post install script of the bareos-webui RPM package for RHEL/CentOS was fixed, it no longer tries to run a2enmod which does not exist on RHEL/CentOS.

-  WebUI: The login form no longer allows redirects to arbitrary URLs

-  WebUI: The used ZendFramework components were updated from version 2.4.10 to 2.4.11.

-  WebUI: jQuery was updated from version 1.12.4 to version 3.2.0., some outdated browsers like Internet Explorer 6-8, Opera 12.1x or Safari 5.1+ will no longer be supported, see `jQuery Browser Support <http://jquery.com/browser-support/>`_ for details.

\                `<http://download.bareos.com/bareos/release/16.2/>`_
================ ===============================================

First stable release of the Bareos 16.2 branch.

-  Configuration

   -  Bareos packages contain the default configuration in :ref:`section-ConfigurationSubdirectories`. Please read :ref:`section-UpdateToConfigurationSubdirectories` before updating (make a copy of your configuration directories for your |bareosDir| and |bareosSd| before updating). Note: as the old configuration files are still supported, in most cases no changes are required.

   -  The default configuration does no longer name the :sup:`Dir`\ :strong:`Director` and :sup:`Sd`\ :strong:`Storage` resources after the systems hostname (:file:`$HOSTNAME-dir` resp. :file:`$HOSTNAME-sd`) but use **bareos-dir**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Director`  resp. **bareos-sd**:sup:`Sd`:sub:`Storage`  as defaults. The prior solution had the disadvantage, that :file:`$HOSTNAME-dir` has also been set on |bareosFd| not running on the
      |bareosDir|, which almost ever did require changing this setting. Also the new approach aligns better with :ref:`section-ConfigurationSubdirectories`.

   -  Due to limitation of the build system, the default resource **Linux All**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`  have been renamed to **LinuxAll**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`FileSet`  (no space between Linux and All).

   -  The configuration of the **bareos-traymonitor** has also been split into resource files. Additional, these resource files are now packaged in other packages:

      -  :file:`CONFIGDIR/tray-monitor.d/monitor/bareos-mon.conf`: **bareos-traymonitor**

      -  :file:`CONFIGDIR/tray-monitor.d/client/FileDaemon-local.conf`: **bareos-filedaemon**

      -  :file:`CONFIGDIR/tray-monitor.d/storage/StorageDaemon-local.conf`: **bareos-storage**

      -  :file:`CONFIGDIR/tray-monitor.d/director/Director-local.conf`: :file:`bareos-director`

      This way, the **bareos-traymonitor** will be configured automatically for the installed components.

-  Strict ACL handling

   -  Bareos Console :strong:`Acl`s do no longer automatically matches substrings (to avoid that e.g. :config:option:`dir/console/PoolAcl`\ = **Full** also matches **VirtualFull**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`pool`\ ). To configure the ACL to work as before, :config:option:`dir/console/PoolAcl`\ = **.*Full.*** must be set. Unfortunately the |bareosWebui| 15.2 **webui**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Profile`  did use
      :config:option:`dir/console/CommandAcl`\ = **.bvfs***, which is also no longer works as intended. Moreover, to use all of |bareosWebui| 16.2 features, some additional commands must be permitted, so best use the new **webui-admin**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Profile` .

-  

   |bareosWebui|

   -  Updating from Bareos 15.2: Adapt **webui**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Profile`  (from bareos 15.2) to allow all commands of **webui-admin**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Profile`  (:config:option:`dir/console/CommandAcl`\ ). Alternately modify all :sup:`Dir`\ :strong:`Console`s currently using **webui**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Profile`  to use **webui-admin**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Profile`  instead.

   -  While RHEL 6 and CentOS 6 are still platforms supported by Bareos, the package **bareos-webui** is not available for these platforms, as the required ZendFramework 2.4 do require PHP >= 5.3.17 (5.3.23). However, it is possible to use **bareos-webui** 15.2 against **bareos-director** 16.2. Also here, the profile must be adapted.

First stable release of the Bareos 15.2 branch.

When coming from bareos-14.2.x, the following things have changed (same as in bareos-15.2.1):

-  The default setting for the Bacula Compatbile mode in :config:option:`fd/client/Compatible`\  and :config:option:`sd/storage/Compatible`\  have been changed from :strong:`yes` to :strong:`no`.

-  The configuration syntax for Storage Daemon Cloud Backends Ceph and GlusterFS have changed. Before bareos-15.2, options have been configured as part of the :config:option:`sd/device/ArchiveDevice`\  directive, while now the Archive Device contains only information text and options are defined via the :config:option:`sd/device/DeviceOptions`\  directive. See examples in :config:option:`sd/device/DeviceOptions`\ .

It is known, that :command:`drop_database` scripts will not longer work on PostgreSQL < 8.4. However, as :command:`drop_database` scripts are very seldom needed, package dependencies do not yet enforce PostgreSQL >= 8.4. We plan to ensure this in future version of Bareos.

================ ===============================================

This release contains several bugfixes, including one major bugfix (:issue:`437`), relevant for those of you using backup to disk with autolabeling enabled.

It can lead to loss of a 64k block of data when all of this conditions apply:

-  backups are written to disk (tape backups are not affected)

-  autolabelling is enabled

-  a backup spans over multiple volumes

-  the additional volumes are newly created and labeled during the backup

If existing volumes are used for backups spanning over multiple volumes, the problem does not occur.

We recommend to update to the latest packages as soon as possible.

If an update is not possible immediately, autolabeling should be disabled and volumes should be labelled manually until the update can be installed.

If you are affected by the 64k bug, we recommend that you schedule a full backup after fixing the problem in order to get a proper full backup of all files.
