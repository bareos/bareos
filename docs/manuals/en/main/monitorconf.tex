\chapter{Monitor Configuration}
\label{sec:MonitorConfig}
\index[general]{Monitor Configuration}
\index[general]{Configuration!Monitor}

The Monitor configuration file is a stripped down version of the Director
configuration file, mixed with a Console configuration file. It simply
contains the information necessary to contact Directors, Clients, and Storage
daemons you want to monitor.

For a general discussion of configuration file and resources including the
data types recognized by {\bf Bareos}, please see the
\ilink{Configuration}{ConfigureChapter} chapter of this manual.

The following Monitor Resource definition must be defined:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\ilink{Monitor}{MonitorResource} -- to  define the Monitor's
name used to connect to all the daemons and  the password used to connect to
the Directors. Note, you must not  define more than one Monitor resource in
the  Monitor configuration file.

\item At least one
\ilink{Client}{ClientResource1},
\ilink{Storage}{StorageResource1} or
\ilink{Director}{DirectorResource2} resource, to define the daemons to monitor.
\end{itemize}

\section{Monitor Resource}
\label{MonitorResource}
\index[general]{Monitor Resource}
\index[general]{Resource!Monitor}

The Monitor resource defines the attributes of the Monitor running on the
network. The parameters you define here must be configured as a Director
resource in Clients and Storages configuration files, and as a Console
resource in Directors configuration files.

\section{Director Resource}
\label{DirectorResource2}
\index[general]{Director Resource}
\index[general]{Resource!Director}

The Director resource defines the attributes of the Directors that are
monitored by this Monitor.

As you are not permitted to define a Password in this resource, to avoid
obtaining full Director privileges, you must create a Console resource in the
\ilink{Director's configuration}{DirectorChapter} file, using the
Console Name and Password defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security
problems, you should configure this Console resource to allow access to no
other daemons, and permit the use of only two commands: {\bf status} and {\bf
.status} (see below for an example).

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor
configuration file.

\section{Client Resource}
\label{ClientResource1}
\index[general]{Resource!Client}
\index[general]{Client Resource}

The Client resource defines the attributes of the Clients that are monitored
by this Monitor.

You must create a Director resource in the
\ilink{Client's configuration}{FiledConfChapter} file, using the
Director Name defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you
should set the {\bf Monitor} directive to {\bf Yes} in this Director resource.


You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor
configuration file.

\section{Storage Resource}
\label{StorageResource1}
\index[general]{Resource!Storage}
\index[general]{Storage Resource}

The Storage resource defines the attributes of the Storages that are monitored
by this Monitor.

You must create a Director resource in the
\ilink{Storage's configuration}{StoredConfChapter} file, using the
Director Name defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you
should set the {\bf Monitor} directive to {\bf Yes} in this Director resource.

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor
configuration file.

\section{Tray Monitor}

\subsection*{Tray Monitor Security}
\index[general]{Tray Monitor Security}
\index[general]{Security!Tray Monitor}

There is no security problem in relaxing the permissions on
tray-monitor.conf as long as FD, SD and DIR are configured properly, so
the passwords contained in this file only gives access to the status of
the daemons. It could be a security problem if you consider the status
information as potentially dangerous
(most people consider this as not being dangerous).

Concerning Director's configuration: \\
In tray-monitor.conf, the password in the Monitor resource must point to
a restricted console in bareos-dir.conf (see the documentation). So, if
you use this password with bconsole, you'll only have access to the
status of the director (commands status and .status).
It could be a security problem if there is a bug in the ACL code of the
director.

Concerning File and Storage Daemons' configuration:\\
In tray-monitor.conf, the Name in the Monitor resource must point to a
Director resource in bareos-fd/sd.conf, with the Monitor directive set
to {\bf Yes} (see the documentation).
It could be a security problem if there is a bug in the code which check
if a command is valid for a Monitor (this is very unlikely as the code
is pretty simple).


\subsection*{Example Tray Monitor configuration}

An example Tray Monitor configuration file might be the following:

\begin{bconfig}{Example tray-monitor.conf}
#
# Bareos Tray Monitor Configuration File
#
Monitor {
  Name = rufus-mon        # password for Directors
  Password = "GN0uRo7PTUmlMbqrJ2Gr1p0fk0HQJTxwnFyE4WSST3MWZseR"
  RefreshInterval = 10 seconds
}

Client {
  Name = rufus-fd
  Address = rufus
  FDPort = 9102           # password for FileDaemon
  Password = "FYpq4yyI1y562EMS35bA0J0QC0M2L3t5cZObxT3XQxgxppTn"
}
Storage {
  Name = rufus-sd
  Address = rufus
  SDPort = 9103           # password for StorageDaemon
  Password = "9usxgc307dMbe7jbD16v0PXlhD64UVasIDD0DH2WAujcDsc6"
}
Director {
  Name = rufus-dir
  DIRport = 9101
  address = rufus
}
\end{bconfig}



\subsubsection*{Example File daemon's Director record}

\begin{bconfig}{Example Monitor resource}
#
# Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the
#   status of the file daemon
#
Director {
  Name = rufus-mon
  Password = "FYpq4yyI1y562EMS35bA0J0QC0M2L3t5cZObxT3XQxgxppTn"
  Monitor = yes
}
\end{bconfig}
