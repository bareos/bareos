Debug Messages
--------------

The Bareos programs contain a lot of debug messages. Normally, these are not printed.
See the :ref:`setdebug <bcommandSetdebug>` chapter about how to enable them.

.. _AccessProblems:

Client Access Problems
----------------------

.. index::
   single: Problem; Cannot Access a Client

There are several reasons why a |dir| could not contact a client on a different machine. They are:

-  Check if the client file daemon is really running.

-  The Client address or port is incorrect or not resolved by DNS. See if you can ping the client
   machine using the same address as in the Client record.

-  You have a firewall, and it is blocking traffic on port 9102 between the Director’s machine and
   the Client’s machine (or on port 9103 between the Client and the Storage daemon machines).

-  Your password or names are not correct in both the Director and the Client machine. Try
   configuring everything identical to how you run the client on the same machine as the Director,
   but just change the address. If that works, make the other changes one step at a time until it
   works.

Some of the DNS and Firewall problems can be circumvented by configuring clients as
:ref:`section-PassiveClient` or using :ref:`section-ClientInitiatedConnection` .


Difficulties Connecting from the FD to the SD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Problem; Connecting from the FD to the SD

If you are having difficulties getting one or more of your File daemons to connect to the Storage
daemon, it is most likely because you have not used a fully qualified domain name on the
:config:option:`dir/storage/Address`\  directive. That is the resolver on the File daemon’s machine
(not on the Director’s) must be able to resolve the name you supply into an IP address. An example
of an address that is guaranteed not to work: :strong:`localhost`. An example that may work:
:strong:`bareos-sd1`. An example that is more likely to work: :strong:`bareos-sd1.example.com`.

You can verify how a |fd| resolves a DNS name by the following command:

.. code-block:: bconsole
   :caption: Test DNS resolution on the |fd| \name{bareos-fd}

   *<input>resolve client=bareos-fd NONEXISTINGHOSTNAME</input>
   Connecting to Client bareos-fd at bareos:9102
   bareos-fd: Failed to resolve NONEXISTINGHOSTNAME
   *<input>resolve client=bareos-fd bareos-sd1.example.com</input>
   Connecting to Client bareos-fd at bareos:9102
   bareos-fd resolves bareos-sd1.example.com to host[ipv4;192.168.0.1]


If your address is correct, then make sure that no other program is using the port 9103 on the
Storage daemon’s machine. The Bacula project has reserved these port numbers by IANA, therefore
they should only be used by Bacula and its replacements like Bareos. However, apparently some
HP printers do use these port numbers. A :command:`ss -lntp` on the |sd|’s machine can
determine who is listening on the 9103 port (used for FD to SD communications in Bareos).

Authorization Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Problem; Authorization Errors
   single: Concurrent Jobs

.. _AuthorizationErrors:


For security reasons, Bareos requires that both the |fd| and the |sd| know the name of the |dir|
as well as its password. As a consequence, if you change the |dir|’s name or password, you must
make the corresponding change in the |fd|’s and in the |sd|’s configuration files.

During the authorization process, the |fd| and |sd| also require that the |dir| authenticates
itself, so both ends require the other to have the correct name and password.

If you have edited the configuration files and modified any name or any password, and you are
getting authentication errors, then your best bet is to go back to the original configuration
files generated by the Bareos installation process. Make only the absolutely necessary modifications
to these files – e.g. add the correct email address. Then follow the instructions in the
:ref:`Running Bareos <TutorialChapter>` chapter of this manual. You will run a backup to disk and
a restore.
Only when that works, should you begin customization of the configuration files.

Some users report that authentication fails if there is not a proper reverse DNS lookup entry for
the machine. This seems to be a requirement of gethostbyname(), which is what Bareos uses to
translate names into IP addresses. If you cannot add a reverse DNS entry, or you don’t know how to
do so, you can avoid the problem by specifying an IP address rather than a machine name in the
appropriate Bareos configuration file.

Here is a picture that indicates what names/passwords in which files/Resources must match up:

.. image:: /include/images/Conf-Diagram.*
   :width: 80.0%


In the left column, you will find the |dir|, |sd|, and |fd| resources, with their names and
passwords – these are all in the |dir| configuration. The right column is where the corresponding
values should be found in the Console, |sd| (SD), and |fd| (FD) configuration files.

Another thing to check is to ensure that the Bareos component you are trying to access has
:strong:`Maximum Concurrent Jobs`\  set large enough to handle each of the Jobs and the Console
that want to connect simultaneously. Once the maximum connections has been reached, each Bareos
component will reject all new connections.


.. _ConcurrentJobs:

.. _section-Interleaving:

Concurrent Jobs
---------------

.. index::
   single: Job; Concurrent Jobs
   single: Running Concurrent Jobs
   single: Concurrent Jobs

Bareos can run multiple concurrent jobs. Using the :strong:`Maximum Concurrent Jobs`\  directives,
you can configure how many and which jobs can be run simultaneously:

|dir|

   - :config:option:`dir/director/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\

   - :config:option:`dir/client/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\

   - :config:option:`dir/job/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\

   - :config:option:`dir/storage/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\

|sd|

   - :config:option:`sd/device/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\


For example, if you want two different jobs to run simultaneously backing up the same Client to
the same Storage device, they will run concurrently only if you have set
:strong:`Maximum Concurrent Jobs`\  greater than one in the :config:option:`Dir/Director`\
resource, the :config:option:`Dir/Client`\  resource, and the :config:option:`Dir/Storage`\
resource in |dir| configuration.

When running concurrent jobs without :ref:`section-DataSpooling`, the volume format becomes more
complicated, consequently, restores may take longer if Bareos must sort through interleaved volume
blocks from multiple simultaneous jobs. This can be avoided by having each simultaneous job write
to a different volume or by using data spooling. We recommend that you read the
:ref:`section-DataSpooling` of this manual first, then test your multiple concurrent backup
including restore testing before you put it into production.

When using random access media as backup space (e.g. disk), you should also read the chapter
about :ref:`ConcurrentDiskJobs`.

Below is a super stripped down |dir| configuration showing you the four places where that must be
modified to allow the same job :config:option:`Dir/Job = NightlySave`\  to run up to four times
concurrently. The change to the Job resource is not necessary if you want different Jobs to run
at the same time, which is the normal case.

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: Concurrent Jobs Example

    #
    # Bareos Director Configuration /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/*
    #
    Director {
      Name = bareos-dir
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
      ...
    }
    Client {
      Name = bareos-fd
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
      ...
    }
    Storage {
      Name = File
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
      ...
    }
    Job {
      Name = "NightlySave"
      Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
      Client = bareos-fd
      Storage = File
      ...
    }



.. note::

   :sinceVersion:`24.0.0: Maximum Concurrent Jobs` the following directives have been deprecated and
   can be removed from any configuration.

   |sd|

     - :config:option:`fd/client/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\

   |fd|

     - :config:option:`fd/client/MaximumConcurrentJobs`\



.. _AnsiLabelsChapter:


Tape Labels: ANSI or IBM
------------------------

.. warning::

   ANSI/IBM labels have been deprecated as of Bareos 23.
   Support will be removed in the future.


.. index::
   single: Label; Tape Labels
   single: Tape; Label; ANSI
   single: Tape; Label; IBM

By default, Bareos uses its own tape label (:config:option:`dir/pool/LabelType`\ ). However, Bareos
also supports reading and writing ANSI and IBM tape labels.

Reading
~~~~~~~

Reading ANSI/IBM labels is important, if some of your tapes are used by other programs that also
support ANSI/IBM labels. For example, LTFS tapes :index:`\ <single: Tape; LTFS>`\  are indicated
by an ANSI label.

If your are running Bareos in such an environment, you must set
:config:option:`sd/device/CheckLabels`\  to yes, otherwise Bareos will not recognize that these
tapes are already in use.

Writing
~~~~~~~

To configure Bareos to also write ANSI/IBM tape labels, use :config:option:`dir/pool/LabelType`\  or
:config:option:`sd/device/LabelType`\ . With the proper configuration, you can force Bareos to
require ANSI or IBM labels.

Even though Bareos will recognize and write ANSI and IBM labels, it always writes its own tape
labels as well.

If you have labeled your volumes outside of Bareos, then the ANSI/IBM label will be recognized by
Bareos only if you have created the HDR1 label with BAREOS.DATA in the filename field (starting with
character 5). If Bareos writes the labels, it will use this information to recognize the tape as a
Bareos tape. This allows ANSI/IBM labeled tapes to be used at sites with multiple machines and
multiple backup programs.

.. _TapeTestingChapter:

Tape Drive
----------

.. index::
   single: Problem; Tape

This chapter is concerned with testing and configuring your tape drive to make sure that it will
work properly with Bareos using the btape program.

Get Your Tape Drive Working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, you should follow the following steps to get your tape drive to work with Bareos. Start
with a tape mounted in your drive. If you have an autochanger, load a tape into the drive. We use
:file:`/dev/nst0` as the tape drive name, you will need to adapt it according to your system.

Do not proceed to the next item until you have succeeded with the previous one.

#. Make sure that Bareos (the Storage daemon) is not running or that you have unmounted the drive
   you will use for testing.

#. Use tar to write to, then read from your drive:



   ::

         mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
         tar cvf /dev/nst0 .
         mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
         tar tvf /dev/nst0



#. Make sure you have a valid and correct Device resource corresponding to your drive. For Linux
   users, generally, the default one works. For FreeBSD users, there are two possible Device
   configurations (see below). For other drives and/or OSes, you will need to first ensure that
   your system tape modes are properly setup (see below), then possibly modify you Device resource
   depending on the output from the :command:`btape` program (next item). When doing this, you
   should consult the :ref:`Storage Daemon Configuration <StoredConfChapter>` of this manual.

#. If you are using a Fibre Channel to connect your tape drive to Bareos, please be sure to disable
   any caching in the NSR (network storage router, which is a Fibre Channel to SCSI converter).

#. Run the :command:`btape` test command:


   ::

         btape /dev/nst0
         test



   It isn’t necessary to run the autochanger part of the test at this time, but do not go past
   this point until the basic test succeeds. If you do have an autochanger, please be sure to
   read the :ref:`Autochanger chapter <AutochangersChapter>` of this manual.

#. Run the btape fill command, preferably with two volumes. This can take a long time. If you have
   an autochanger and it is configured, Bareos will automatically use it. If you do not have it
   configured, you can manually issue the appropriate mtx command, or press the autochanger buttons
   to change the tape when requested to do so.

#. Run Bareos, and backup a reasonably small directory, say 60 Megabytes. Do three successive
   backups of this directory.

#. Stop Bareos, then restart it. Do another full backup of the same directory. Then stop and
   restart Bareos.

#. Do a restore of the directory backed up, by entering the following restore command, being careful
   to restore it to an alternate location:



   ::

         restore select all done
         yes



   Do a diff on the restored directory to ensure it is identical to the original directory. If you
   are going to backup multiple different systems (Linux, Windows, Mac, Solaris, FreeBSD, ...), be
   sure you test the restore on each system type.

#. If you have an autochanger, you should now go back to the btape program and run the autochanger
   test:



   ::

           btape /dev/nst0
           auto



   Adjust your autochanger as necessary to ensure that it works correctly. See the
   :ref:`Autochanger chapter <AutochangerTesting>` of this manual for a complete discussion of
   testing your autochanger.


.. _TapeSpeedTesting:

Testing & Debugging Tape Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. index::
   single: Tape; Speed; Testing
   single: Problem; Tape; Speed

If you find that your tape drive is not keeping up with the data rate of your backups, you can check
several things to help determine the cause of the problem.

Please consider the following informations when testing tape speed:

#. Please set the tape drive device :config:option:`sd/device/MaximumFileSize` to a reasonable value.
   For LTO-7 a value of 200 GiB should work pretty good. You can change the value at will. While it will
   affect organization of data on your tapes, it will be read and write compatible no matter what you
   configure.

   For a little context: When Bareos writes to tape, it adds a **file-mark** now and then to improve search
   times on restore. By default these file-marks are written in immediate mode (i.e. the syscall will
   only return after the file mark was physically written to the tape). Thus every file-mark will imply
   a buffer-flush of the drive. While this may not sound like a problem, modern tape drives have
   internal buffers of 1 GiB and more. Thus writing a file-mark every 1 GiB (which is still the no more
   well suited default in Bareos), will result in the buffer being flushed before it is filled.

#. Do tape performance tests with incompressible random data, everything else will produce bogus
   results that are toally misleading. The data size must also be bigger than the buffer size of the drive,
   otherwise the drive will just write from its buffer and not from the host, which will also produce
   bogus results.

   The following command will write 1 GiB of random data to tape, which should be enough for testing
   most drives. You can increase the count if you have a very fast drive or if you want to test with
   more data.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: write random data to tape with raw tools, considering /tmp being a memory tmpfs

   dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/random bs=1M count=1024 status=progress
      1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB, 1.0 GiB) copied, 2.41229 s, 445 MB/s

      tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
      /tmp/random
      Total bytes written: 1073745920 (1.1GiB, 210MiB/s)


tapestat command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can monitor performance operations of your tape drive using the :command:`tapestat 1` during a
job to see how well your tape drive is keeping up with the data rate.

.. image:: /include/images/tapestat_output.png
   :alt: tapestat output sample
   :width: 80.0%


sg_logs command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use the :command:`sg_logs --all /dev/sgX` command to see detailled informations about
the tape drive status and performance or errors counters. Where :file:`/dev/sgX` is the the SCSI
generic device corresponding to your tape drive. (see :command:`lsscsi -g`)

Output vary depending if the tape is loaded or not, and drive model.

Testing Autochanger and Adapting mtx-changer script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



.. _section-MtxChangerManualUsage:

.. index::
   single: Autochanger; Testing
   single: Autochanger; mtx-changer
   single: Command; mtx-changer
   single: Problem; Autochanger
   single: Problem; mtx-changer

In case Bareos does not work well with the Autochanger, it is preferable to "hand-test" that the
changer works. To do so, we suggest you do the following commands:

Make sure Bareos is not running.

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 list 0 /dev/nst0 0`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer list

This command should print:



::

      1:
      2:
      3:
      ...



or one number per line for each slot that is occupied in your changer, and the number should be
terminated by a colon (:). If your changer has barcodes, the barcode will follow the colon. If an
error message is printed, you must resolve the problem (e.g. try a different SCSI control device
name if /dev/sch0 is incorrect). For example, on FreeBSD systems, the autochanger SCSI control device
is generally /dev/pass2.

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 listall 0 /dev/nst0 0`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer listall

This command should print:



::

    Drive content:         D:Drive num:F:Slot loaded:Volume Name
    D:0:F:2:vol2        or D:Drive num:E
    D:1:F:42:vol42
    D:3:E

    Slot content:
    S:1:F:vol1             S:Slot num:F:Volume Name
    S:2:E               or S:Slot num:E
    S:3:F:vol4

    Import/Export tray slots:
    I:10:F:vol10           I:Slot num:F:Volume Name
    I:11:E              or I:Slot num:E
    I:12:F:vol40



:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 transfer 1 2`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer transfer

This command should transfer a volume from source (1) to destination (2)

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 slots`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer slots

This command should return the number of slots in your autochanger.

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 unload 1 /dev/nst0 0`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer unload

If a tape is loaded from slot 1, this should cause it to be unloaded.

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 load 3 /dev/nst0 0`

.. index::`
   single: mtx-changer load

Assuming you have a tape in slot 3, it will be loaded into drive (0).

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 loaded 0 /dev/nst0 0`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer loaded

It should print "3" Note, we have used an "illegal" slot number 0. In this case, it is simply
ignored because the slot number is not used. However, it must be specified because the drive
parameter at the end of the command is needed to select the correct drive.

:command:`/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 unload 3 /dev/nst0 0`

.. index::
   single: mtx-changer unload

will unload the tape into slot 3.

Once all the above commands work correctly, assuming that you have the right Changer Command in your
configuration, Bareos should be able to operate the changer. The only remaining area of problems
will be if your autoloader needs some time to get the tape loaded after issuing the command.
After the mtx-changer script returns, Bareos will immediately rewind and read the tape. If Bareos
gets rewind I/O errors after a tape change, you will probably need to configure the
:strong:`load_sleep` paramenter in the config file :file:`/etc/bareos/mtx-changer.conf`. You can
test whether or not you need a sleep by putting the following commands into a file and running it
as a script:



.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: Testing if sleep is needed between unload and load

   #!/bin/sh
   /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 unload 1 /dev/nst0 0
   /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 load 3 /dev/nst0 0
   mt -f /dev/st0 rewind
   mt -f /dev/st0 weof



If the above script runs, you probably have no timing problems. If it does not run, start by putting
a sleep 30 or possibly a sleep 60 in the script just after the mtx-changer load command. If that
works, then you should configure the :strong:`load_sleep` paramenter in the config file
:file:`/etc/bareos/mtx-changer.conf` to the specified value so that it will be effective when
Bareos runs.

A second problem that comes up with a small number of autochangers is that they need to have the
cartridge ejected before it can be removed. If this is the case, the load 3 will never succeed
regardless of how long you wait. If this seems to be your problem, you can insert an eject just
after the unload so that the script looks like:



.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: Testing if offline is needed

   #!/bin/sh
   /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 unload 1 /dev/nst0 0
   mt -f /dev/st0 offline
   /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sch0 load 3 /dev/nst0 0
   mt -f /dev/st0 rewind
   mt -f /dev/st0 weof



If this solves your problems, set the parameter :strong:`offline` in the config file
:file:`/etc/bareos/mtx-changer.conf` to "1".


Restore
-------

Restore a pruned job using a pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Restore; pruned job
   single: Problem; Restore; pruned file job
   single: Regex

It is possible to configure Bareos in a way, that job information are still stored in the Bareos
catalog, while the individual file information are already pruned.

If all File records are pruned from the catalog for a Job, normally Bareos can restore only all
files saved. That is there is no way using the catalog to select individual files. With this new
feature, Bareos will ask if you want to specify a Regex expression for extracting only a part of
the full backup.

.. code-block:: bconsole
   :caption: Restoring pruned files job using regex to filter


     Building directory tree for JobId(s) 1,3 ...
     There were no files inserted into the tree, so file selection
     is not possible.Most likely your retention policy pruned the files

     Do you want to restore all the files? (yes|no): no

     Regexp matching files to restore? (empty to abort): /etc/.*

See also :ref:`FileRegex bsr option <FileRegex>` for more information.

Problems Restoring Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Restore; Files; Problem
   single: Problem; Restoring Files
   single: Problem; Tape; fixed mode
   single: Problem; Tape; variable mode

The most frequent problems users have restoring files are error messages such as:


.. code-block:: none

   04-Jan 00:33 z217-sd: RestoreFiles.2005-01-04_00.31.04 Error:
   block.c:868 Volume data error at 20:0! Short block of 512 bytes on
   device /dev/tape discarded.



or


.. code-block:: none

   04-Jan 00:33 z217-sd: RestoreFiles.2005-01-04_00.31.04 Error:
   block.c:264 Volume data error at 20:0! Wanted ID: "BB02", got ".".
   Buffer discarded.



Both these kinds of messages indicate that you were probably running your tape drive in fixed block
mode rather than variable block mode. Fixed block mode will work with any program that reads tapes
sequentially such as tar, but Bareos repositions the tape on a block basis when restoring files
because this will speed up the restore by orders of magnitude when only a few files are being
restored. There are several ways that you can attempt to recover from this unfortunate situation.

Try the following things, each separately, and reset your Device resource to what it is now after
each individual test:

#. Set :config:option:`sd/device/BlockPositioning = no` in your Device resource and try the restore.
   This is a new directive and untested.

#. Set :config:option:`sd/device/MinimumBlockSize = 512` and :config:option:`sd/device/MaximumBlockSize = 512`
   and try the restore. If you are able to determine the block size your drive was previously using,
   you should try that size if 512 does not work. This is a really horrible solution, and it is not
   at all recommended to continue backing up your data without correcting this condition.
   Please see the :ref:`TapeTestingChapter` section for more on this.

#. Try editing the :file:`restore.bsr` file at the Run xxx yes/mod/no prompt before starting the
   restore job and remove all the VolBlock statements. These are what causes Bareos to reposition
   the tape, and where problems occur if you have a fixed block size set for your drive. The VolFile
   commands also cause repositioning, but this will work regardless of the block size.

#. Use :command:`bextract` to extract the files you want – it reads the Volume sequentially if you
   use the include list feature, or if you use a .bsr file, but remove all the VolBlock statements
   after the .bsr file is created (at the Run yes/mod/no) prompt but before you start the restore.


Restoring Files Can Be Slow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: Restore; slow
   single: Problem; Restore; slow

Restoring files is generally much slower than backing them up for several reasons. The first is that
during a backup the tape is normally already positioned and Bareos only needs to write. On the other
hand, because restoring files is done so rarely, Bareos keeps only the start file and block on the
tape for the whole job rather than on a file by file basis which would use quite a lot of space in
the catalog.

Bareos will forward space to the correct file mark on the tape for the Job, then forward space to
the correct block, and finally sequentially read each record until it gets to the correct one(s) for
the file or files you want to restore. Once the desired files are restored, Bareos will stop reading
the tape.

Finally, instead of just reading a file for backup, during the restore, Bareos must create the file,
and the operating system must allocate disk space for the file as Bareos is restoring it.

For all the above reasons the restore process is generally much slower than backing up (sometimes it
takes three times as long).


.. _section-RestoreCatalog:

Restoring When Things Go Wrong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   pair: Catalog; Restore
   single: Disaster; Recovery; Catalog
   single: Problem; Repair Catalog

This and the following sections will try to present a few of the kinds of problems that can come up
making restoring more difficult. We will try to provide a few ideas how to get out of these problem
situations. In addition to what is presented here, there is more specific information on restoring a
:ref:`Client <section-BareMetalRestoreClient>`\  and your :ref:`Server <section-RestoreServer>`\  in
the :ref:`RescueChapter`\  chapter of this manual.

Problem
   My database is broken.

Solution
   See the PostgreSQL documentation. They have specific tools that check and repair databases, see
   the :ref:`CatMaintenanceChapter`\  sections of this manual for links to vendor information.

   Assuming the above does not resolve the problem, you will need to restore or rebuild your
   catalog. Note, if it is a matter of some inconsistencies in the Bareos tables rather than a
   broken database, then running :ref:`bareos-dbcheck <bareos-dbcheck>` might help, but you will
   need to ensure that your database indexes are properly setup.

Problem
   How do I restore my catalog?

Solution with a Catalog backup
   If you have backed up your database nightly (as you should) and you have made a bootstrap file,
   you can immediately load back your database (or the ASCII SQL output). Make a copy of your
   current database, then re-initialize it, by running the following scripts:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      su postgres -c /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/drop_bareos_tables
      su postgres -c /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/make_bareos_tables
      su postgres -c /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/grant_bareos_privileges

   After re-initializing the database, you should be able to run Bareos. If you now try to use the
   restore command, it will not work because the database will be empty. However, you can manually
   run a restore job and specify your bootstrap file. You do so by entering the run command in the
   console and selecting the restore job. If you are using the default |dir| configuration, this
   Job will be named RestoreFiles. Most likely it will prompt you with something such as:

   .. code-block:: bconsole

      Run Restore job
      JobName:    RestoreFiles
      Bootstrap:  /home/user/bareos/working/restore.bsr
      Where:      /tmp/bareos-restores
      Replace:    always
      FileSet:    Full Set
      Client:     bareos-fd
      Storage:    File
      When:       2012-12-12 17:33:40
      Catalog:    MyCatalog
      Priority:   10
      OK to run? (yes/mod/no):



   A number of the items will be different in your case. What you want to do is: to use the mod
   option to change the Bootstrap to point to your saved bootstrap file; and to make sure all the
   other items such as Client, Storage, Catalog, and Where are correct. The FileSet is not used
   when you specify a bootstrap file. Once you have set all the correct values, run the Job and
   it will restore the backup of your database, which is most likely an ASCII dump.

   You will then need to follow the instructions for your database type to recreate the database
   from the ASCII backup file. See the :ref:`Catalog Maintenance <CatMaintenanceChapter>` chapter
   of this manual for examples of the command needed to restore a database from an ASCII dump
   (they are shown in the Compacting Your XXX Database sections).

   Also, please note that after you restore your database from an ASCII backup, you do NOT want to
   do a `make_bareos_tables` command, or you will probably erase your newly restored database tables.

Solution with a Job listing
   If you did save your database but did not make a bootstrap file, then recovering the database
   is more difficult. You will probably need to use :command:`bextract` to extract the backup copy.
   First you should locate the listing of the job report from the last catalog backup. It has
   important information that will allow you to quickly find your database file. For example, in the
   job report for the **CatalogBackup** shown below, the critical items are the Volume name(s), the
   Volume Session Id and the Volume Session Time.
   If you know those, you can easily restore your Catalog.

   From the above information, you can manually create a bootstrap file, and then follow the
   instructions given above for restoring your database. A reconstructed bootstrap file for the
   above backup Job would look like the following:



   ::

      Volume="DLT-22Apr15"
      VolSessionId=11
      VolSessionTime=1429607926
      FileIndex=1-1



   Where we have inserted the Volume name, Volume Session Id, and Volume Session Time that
   correspond to the values in the job report. We’ve also used a FileIndex of one, which will
   always be the case providing that there was only one file backed up in the job.

   The disadvantage of this bootstrap file compared to what is created when you ask for one to be
   written, is that there is no File and Block specified, so the restore code must search all data
   in the Volume to find the requested file. A fully specified bootstrap file would have the File
   and Blocks specified as follows:



   ::

      Volume="DLT-22Apr15"
      VolSessionId=11
      VolSessionTime=1429607926
      VolFile=118-118
      VolBlock=0-4053
      FileIndex=1-1



   Once you have restored the ASCII dump of the database, you will then to follow the instructions
   for your database type to recreate the database from the ASCII backup file.
   See the :ref:`Catalog Maintenance <CatMaintenanceChapter>` chapter of this manual for examples of
   the command needed to restore a database from an ASCII dump
   (they are shown in the Compacting Your XXX Database sections).

   Also, please note that after you restore your database from an ASCII backup, you do NOT want to
   do a make_bareos_tables command, or you will probably erase your newly restored database tables.

Solution without a Job Listing
   If you do not have a job listing, then it is a bit more difficult. Either you use the
   :ref:`bscan <bscan>` program to scan the contents of your tape into a database, which can be
   very time consuming depending on the size of the tape, or you can use the
   :ref:`bls <bls>`\  program to list everything on the tape, and reconstruct a bootstrap file from
   the bls listing for the file or files you want following the instructions given above.

   There is a specific example of how to use :command:`bls` below.

Problem
   Trying to restore the last known good full backup by specifying item 3 on the restore menu then
   the JobId to restore, but Bareos then reports:



   ::

         1 Job 0 Files



   and restores nothing.

Solution
   Most likely the File records were pruned from the database either due to the File Retention
   period expiring or by explicitly purging the Job. By using the "llist jobid=nn" command, you
   can obtain all the important information about the job:



   ::

      llist jobid=120
                 JobId: 120
                   Job: save.2005-12-05_18.27.33
              Job.Name: save
           PurgedFiles: 0
                  Type: B
                 Level: F
          Job.ClientId: 1
           Client.Name: bareos-fd
             JobStatus: T
             SchedTime: 2005-12-05 18:27:32
             StartTime: 2005-12-05 18:27:35
               EndTime: 2005-12-05 18:27:37
              JobTDate: 1133803657
          VolSessionId: 1
        VolSessionTime: 1133803624
              JobFiles: 236
             JobErrors: 0
       JobMissingFiles: 0
            Job.PoolId: 4
             Pool.Name: Full
         Job.FileSetId: 1
       FileSet.FileSet: BackupSet



   Then you can find the Volume(s) used by doing:



   ::

      sql
      select VolumeName from JobMedia,Media where JobId=1 and JobMedia.MediaId=Media.MediaId;



   Finally, you can create a bootstrap file as described in the previous problem above using this
   information.

   Bareos will ask you if you would like to restore all the files in the job, and it will collect
   the above information and write the bootstrap file for you.

Problem
   You don’t have a bootstrap file, and you don’t have the Job report for the backup of your
   database, but you did backup the database, and you know the Volume to which it was backed up.

Solution
   Either :command:`bscan` the tape (see below for bscanning), or better use :command:`bls` to find
   where it is on the tape, then use :command:`bextract` to restore the database. For example,



   ::

      ./bls -j -V DLT-22Apr15 /dev/nst0



   Might produce the following output:

   ::

      bls: butil.c:258 Using device: "/dev/nst0" for reading.
      21-Jul 18:34 bls: Ready to read from volume "DLT-22Apr15" on device "DLTDrive"
      (/dev/nst0).
      Volume Record: File:blk=0:0 SessId=11 SessTime=1429607926 JobId=0 DataLen=164
      ...
      Begin Job Session Record: File:blk=118:0 SessId=11 SessTime=1429607926
      JobId=7510
         Job=CatalogBackup.2015-04-22_01.10.0 Date=22-Apr-2015 10:21:00 Level=F Type=B
      End Job Session Record: File:blk=118:4053 SessId=11 SessTime=1429607926
      JobId=7510
         Date=22-Apr-2005 10:23:06 Level=F Type=B Files=1 Bytes=210,739,395 Errors=0
      Status=T
      ...
      21-Jul 18:34 bls: End of Volume at file 201 on device "DLTDrive" (/dev/nst0),
      Volume "DLT-22Apr15"
      21-Jul 18:34 bls: End of all volumes.



   Of course, there will be many more records printed, but we have indicated the essential lines of
   output. From the information on the Begin Job and End Job Session Records, you can reconstruct a
   bootstrap file such as the one shown above.

Problem
   How can I find where a file is stored?

Solution
   Normally, it is not necessary, you just use the restore command to restore the most recently
   saved version (menu option 5), or a version saved before a given date (menu option 8). If you
   know the JobId of the job in which it was saved, you can use menu option 3 to enter that JobId.

   If you would like to know the JobId where a file was saved, select restore menu option 2.

   You can also use the query command to find information such as:

   ::

      *query
      Available queries:
           1: List up to 20 places where a File is saved regardless of the
      directory
           2: List where the most recent copies of a file are saved
           3: List last 20 Full Backups for a Client
           4: List all backups for a Client after a specified time
           5: List all backups for a Client
           6: List Volume Attributes for a selected Volume
           7: List Volumes used by selected JobId
           8: List Volumes to Restore All Files
           9: List Pool Attributes for a selected Pool
          10: List total files/bytes by Job
          11: List total files/bytes by Volume
          12: List Files for a selected JobId
          13: List Jobs stored on a selected MediaId
          14: List Jobs stored for a given Volume name
          15: List Volumes Bareos thinks are in changer
          16: List Volumes likely to need replacement from age or errors
      Choose a query (1-16):



Problem
   I didn’t backup my database. What do I do now?

Solution
   This is probably the worst of all cases, and you will probably have to re-create your database
   from scratch and then bscan in all your volumes, which is a very long, painful, and inexact
   process.

   There are basically three steps to take:

   #. Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and that the Bareos database (normally bareos)
      exists. See the :ref:`section-CreateDatabase` chapter of the manual.

   #. Ensure that the Bareos databases are created. This is also described at the above link.

   #. Start and stop the Bareos Director using the probate |dir| configuration files so that it can
      create the Client and Storage records which are not stored on the Volumes. Without these
      records, scanning is unable to connect the Job records to the proper client.

   When the above is complete, you can begin bscanning your Volumes.
   Please see the :ref:`bscan`\  chapter for more details.
