.. _dummydevice:

Use a dummy device to test the backup
-------------------------------------



.. _TestUsingFifoDevice:

 If your are testing your configuration, but donâ€™t want to store the backup data, it is possible to use a dummy FIFO device to test your configuration, see :ref:`Stored configuration <SetupFifo>`.

Obviously, it can not be used to do a restore.

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: FIFO Storage Device Configuration

   Device {
     Name = NULL
     Media Type = NULL
     Device Type = Fifo
     Archive Device = /dev/null
     LabelMedia = yes
     Random Access = no
     AutomaticMount = no
     RemovableMedia = no
     MaximumOpenWait = 60
     AlwaysOpen = no
   }

.. _BackupOtherDBs:

Backup Of Third Party Databases
-------------------------------

:index:`\ <single: Backup; of Third Party Databases>`
:index:`\ <single: Database; Backup Of Third Party>`

If you are running a database in production mode on your machine, Bareos will happily backup the files, but if the database is in use while Bareos is reading it, you may back it up in an unstable state.

The best solution is to shutdown your database before backing it up, or use some tool specific to your database to make a valid live copy perhaps by dumping the database in ASCII format.


.. _MSSQL:

Backup of MSSQL Databases with Bareos Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`\ <single: MSSQL Backup>`\  :index:`\ <single: Database; MSSQL>`\  :index:`\ <single: Plugin; MSSQL backup>`\  

:sinceVersion:`13.2.0: MSSQL`

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you like to use the MSSQL-Plugin to backing up your Databases you need to consider some things:

-  | Database Mode
   | The database need to run in Full Recovery Mode. Otherwise you are not able to use differential and incremental backups or to use point in time recovery.
   | 

.. warning::

   If you set the databases into the mentionend mode you have to consider some maintance facts. The database doesn't shrink or delete the logs unanttended, so you have to shrink them manual once a week and you have to truncate the logs once in a month.

-  | Security and Access
   | For connections you can use a SQL-User or a integrated systemaccount (Windows NT user). Both connection types are supported.

   -  | Standard Security
      | You have to provide user credentials within your options which do belong to user with the sufficent right performing restores and backups from the database. This way stands for an extra backup/restore user.

   -  | Trusted Security
      | You use a systemaccount which have the sufficent rights to performing backups and restores on a database. This systemaccount have to be same account like the bareos-filedeamon runs on.

-  Permissions and Roles

   -  | Server-Role
      | The user should be in the groups sysadmin and dbcreator.

   -  | Database permissions
      | The user have to be a backupoperator and dbowner of the database which you like to backup.

There is no difference for the rights and roles between using a systemaccount (trusted security method) or a extra backup user (standard security method). Please keep in mind if you use the trusted security method you have to use the same system account like the bareos-filedeamon runs on.

.. _MssqlPluginInstallation:

MSSQL Plugin Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Bareos < 14.2, install the Bareos MSSQL plugin onto the MSSQL server you want to backup. Bareos >= 14.2 also allows to backup remote MSSQL servers (option :strong:`serveraddress`).

Bareos Windows-Installer
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Install the Bareos filedaemon including the component "Bareos FileDameon Plugins". Make sure, that you install the file daemon without the "compatible" option.

Manual install
''''''''''''''

After downloading the plugin you need to copy it into :file:`C:\Program Files\Bareos\Plugins`. Then you need to define the plugin directory and which plugin the bareos-filedaemon should use. You have to edit the bareos-filedaemon resource in :file:`C:\Program Data\bareos-fd.conf` as follows:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: MSSQL plugin configuration

   FileDaemon {
     Name = mssqlserver-fd
     Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20

     # remove comment in next line to load plugins from specified directory
     Plugin Directory = "C:/Program Files/Bareos/Plugins"

     Plugin Names = "mssqlvdi"
     compatible = no  # this is the default since bareos 15
   }

Plugin Test
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bconsole
   :caption: status client=mssqlserver-fd

   *<input>status client=mssqlserver-fd</input>

     log sequence number: 'lsn:15000000040000037'

Configure the FileSet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the plugin you need to configure it in the fileset as a plugin resource. For each database instance you need to define a exclusive backup job and fileset.

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: MSSQL FileSet

   Fileset {
     Name = "Mssql"
     Enable VSS = no
     Include {
       Options {
         Signature = MD5
       }
       Plugin = "mssqlvdi:instance=default:database=myDatabase:username=bareos:password=bareos"
     }
   }

In this example we use the standard security method for the connection.

Used options in the plugin string are:

mssqlvdi
   This is the reference to the MSSQL plugin.

serveraddress
   (:sinceVersion:`14.2.2: MSSQL: serveraddress`) Defines the server address to connect to (if empty defaults to localhost).

instance
   Defines the instance within the database server.

database
   Defines the database that should get backed up.

username and password
   Username and Password are required, when the connection is done using a MSSQL user. If the systemaccount the bareos-fd runs with has succifient permissions, this is not required.

It is recommend to define an additional restore job.

For every database separate job and FileSet are required.

Run Backups
^^^^^^^^^^^

Here you can see an example for a backup:

.. code-block:: bconsole

At least you gain a full backup which contains the follow:



::

   @MSSQL/
   @MSSQL/default/
   @MSSQL/default/myDatabase/
   @MSSQL/default/myDatabase/db-full



| So if you perform your first full backup your are capable to perfom differntial and incremental backups.
| Differntial FileSet example:



::

   /@MSSQL/
   /@MSSQL/default/
   /@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/
   /@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/db-full
   /@MSSQL/default/myDatabase/db-diff



Incremental FileSet example:



::

   *@MSSQL/
     *default/
       *myDatabase/
         *db-diff
         *db-full
         *log-2013-11-21 17:32:20



Restores
^^^^^^^^

If you want to perfom a restore of a full backup without differentials or incrementals you have some options which helps you to restore even the corrupted database still exist. But you have to specifiy the options like plugin, instance and database during every backup.

replace=<yes|no>
   With this option you can replace the database if it still exist.

instance
   Defines the server instance whithin the database is running.

database
   Defines the database you want to backup.

If you want to restore the actual backup to a set of backup files which you can use to restore a database under an new name or perform any kind of special operations using for example the sql management studio, you can use a where setting for the restore other then â€™/â€™. When the where is set to â€™/â€™ it will restore to the Virtual Device Interface (VDI).

When you specify for restore a where path which is lets say â€™c:/tempâ€™ the plugin will restore the selected backup files under a relocated path under c:/temp/@MSSQL@/...

Example for a full restore:

.. code-block:: bconsole
   :caption: restore MSSQL database

   *<input>restore client=mssqlserver-fd</input>
   Using Catalog "MyCatalog"

   First you select one or more JobIds that contain files
   to be restored. You will be presented several methods
   of specifying the JobIds. Then you will be allowed to
   select which files from those JobIds are to be restored.

   To select the JobIds, you have the following choices:
        1: List last 20 Jobs run
        2: List Jobs where a given File is saved
        3: Enter list of comma separated JobIds to select
        4: Enter SQL list command
        5: Select the most recent backup for a client
        6: Select backup for a client before a specified time
        7: Enter a list of files to restore
        8: Enter a list of files to restore before a specified time
        9: Find the JobIds of the most recent backup for a client
       10: Find the JobIds for a backup for a client before a specified time
       11: Enter a list of directories to restore for found JobIds
       12: Select full restore to a specified Job date

Restore a Backup Chain
''''''''''''''''''''''

If you like to restore a specific state or a whole chain consists of full, incremental and differential backups you need to use the "norecovery=yes" option. After this the database is in "recovery mode". You can also use a option which put the database right after the restore back into the right mode. If you like to restore certains point with protocols or "LSN" it it not recommend to work with this option.

norecovery=<yes|no>
   This option must be set to yes, if the database server should not do a automatic recovery after the backup. Instead, additional manual maintenace operations are possible.

recoverafterrestore=<yes|no>
   With this command the database is right after backup in the correct mode. If you not use this you have to use the followed tsql statement: 

   ::

          Restore DATABASE yourDatabase WITH RECOVERY
          GO

   

stopbeforemark=<log sequence number specification>
   used for point in time recovery.

stopatmark=<log sequence number specification>
   used for point in time recovery.

stopat=<timestamp>
   used for point in time recovery.

Followed is a example for a restore of full, differential and incremental backup with a replace of the original database:

.. code-block:: bconsole
   :caption: restore MSSQL database chain

   *<input>restore client=mssqlserver-fd</input>

   First you select one or more JobIds that contain files

.. _backup-postgresql:

Backup of a PostgreSQL Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`\ <single: PostgreSQL; Backup>`\  :index:`\ <single: Database; PostgreSQL; Backup>`\  

In this section, we describe different methods how to do backups of the PostgreSQL databases.

Backup of a PostgreSQL Database by using the RunScript directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`\ <single: RunScript; Example>`\ 

One method to backup a PostgreSQL database is to use the :command:`pg_dumpall` tool to dump the database into a file and then backup it as a normal file. After the backup, the file can be removed. It may also be an option not to remove it, so that the latest version is always available immediately. On the next job run it will be overwritten anyway.

This can be done by using :config:option:`dir/job/RunScript`\  directives inside a Job Resource, for example:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: RunScript job resource for a PostgreSQL backup

   Job {
     Name = "BackupDatabase"
     JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
     Client = dbserver-fd
     Level = Full
     FileSet="Database"

     # This creates a dump of our database in the local filesystem on the client
     RunScript {
       FailJobOnError = Yes
       RunsOnClient = Yes
       RunsWhen = Before
       Command = "sh -c 'pg_dumpall -U postgres > /var/lib/bareos/postgresql_dump.sql'"
     }

     # This deletes the dump in our local filesystem on the client
     RunScript {
       RunsOnSuccess = Yes
       RunsOnClient = Yes
       RunsWhen = After
       Command = "rm /var/lib/bareos/postgresql_dump.sql"
     }
   }

   FileSet {
     Name = "Database"
     Include {
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
       # database dump file
       File = "/var/lib/bareos/postgresql_dump.sql"
     }
   }

Note that redirecting the :command:`pg_dumpall` output to a file requires to run the whole command line through a shell, otherwise the :command:`pg_dumpall` would not know what do with the :command:`>` character and the job would fail. As no shell features like redirection or piping are used for the :command:`rm`, the :command:`sh -c` is not needed there. See :config:option:`dir/job/RunScript`\  for more details.

Backup of a PostgreSQL Databases by using the bpipe plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`\ <single: bpipe; PostgreSQL backup>`\ 

Instead of creating a temporary database dump file, the bpipe plugin can be used. For general information about bpipe, see the :ref:`bpipe` section. The bpipe plugin is configured inside the :config:option:`dir/fileset/Include`\  section of a File Set, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bpipe directive for PostgreSQL backup

   FileSet {
     Name = "postgresql-all"
     Include {
       Plugin = "bpipe:file=/POSTGRESQL/dump.sql:reader=pg_dumpall -U postgres:writer=psql -U postgres"
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
     }
   }

This causes the File Daemon to call bpipe plugin, which will write its data into the "pseudo" file :file:`/POSTGRESQL/dump.sql` by calling the program :command:`pg_dumpall -U postgres` to read the data during backup. The :command:`pg_dumpall` command outputs all the data for the database, which will be read by the plugin and stored in the backup. During restore, the data that was backed up will be sent to the program specified in the last field, which in this
case is psql. When psql is called, it will read the data sent to it by the plugin then write it back to the same database from which it came from.

This can also be used, to backup a database that is running on a remote host:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bpipe directive to backup a PostgreSQL database that is running on a remote host

   FileSet {
     Name = "postgresql-remote"
     Include {
       Plugin = "bpipe:file=/POSTGRESQL/dump.sql:reader=pg_dumpall -h <hostname> -U <username> -W <password>:writer=psql -h <hostname> -U <username> -W <password>"
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
     }
   }


.. _backup-postgresql-plugin:

Backup of a PostgreSQL Databases by using the PGSQL-Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`\ <single: Plugin; PostgreSQL Backup>`\  

The PGSQL-Plugin supports an online (Hot) backup of database files and database transaction logs (WAL) archiving (with pgsql-archlog) and backup. With online database and transaction logs the backup plugin can perform Poin-In-Time-Restore up to a single selected transaction or date/time.

Database recovery is performed fully automatic with dedicated pgsql-restore utility.

For a full description, see https://github.com/bareos/contrib-pgsql-plugin/wiki.


.. _backup-mysql:

Backup of a MySQL Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`\ <single: MySQL; Backup>`
:index:`\ <single: Database; MySQL; Backup>`

In this section, we describe different methods to do a full backup of a MySQL database.


.. _backup-mysql-python:

Backup of MySQL Databases using the Python MySQL plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`\ <single: Plugin; MySQL Backup>`\  

The Python plugin from https://github.com/bareos/bareos-contrib/tree/master/fd-plugins/mysql-python makes a backup of all or selected MySQL databases from the |fd| or any other MySQL server. It makes use of the mysqldump command and basically grabs data from mysqldump via pipe. This plugin is suitable to backup database dumps. If you prefer to use mechanisms like incremental hot-backups of InnoDB tables, please use the Bareos MySQL / MariaDB Percona xtrabackup Plugin (see
:ref:`backup-mysql-xtrabackup`).

Following settings must be done on the Bareos client (|fd|):

-  install and enable the |fd| Python plugin

-  install the Python MySQL plugin (for some platforms it is available prepackaged from http://download.bareos.org/bareos/contrib/\ , on the other platforms: copy the plugin files to the Bareos Plugin Directory)

-  disable bacula compatibility (default for Bareos >= 15.2)

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bareos-fd.d/client/myself.conf

   Client {
     ...
     Plugin Directory = /usr/lib64/bareos/plugins
     Plugin Names = "python"
     compatible = no
   }

Configure the plugin in the |dir|:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/fileset/mysql.conf

   FileSet {
       Name = "mysql"
       Include {
         Options {
           signature = MD5
           compression = lz4
         }
         Plugin = "python:module_path=/usr/lib64/bareos/plugins:module_name=bareos-fd-mysql:db=test,wikidb"
         #Plugin = "python:module_path=/usr/lib64/bareos/plugins:module_name=bareos-fd-mysql:mysqlhost=dbhost:mysqluser=bareos:mysqlpassword=bareos"
       }
   }

In the above example the plugin creates and saves a dump from the databases called :strong:`test` and :strong:`wikidb`, running on the file-daemon. The commented example below specifies an explicit MySQL server called :strong:`dbhost`, and connects with user :strong:`bareos`, password :strong:`bareos`, to create and save a backup of all databases.

The plugin creates a pipe internally, thus no extra space on disk is needed. You will find one file per database in the backups in the virtual directory :file:`/_mysqlbackups_`.

List of supported options:

db
   comma separated list of databases to save, where each database will be stored in a separate file. If ommited, all databases will be saved.

dumpbinary
   command (with or without full path) to create the dumps. Default: :strong:`mysqldump`

dumpoptions
   options for dumpbinary, default: ":strong:`--events --single-transaction`"

drop_and_recreate
   if not set to :strong:`false`, adds :strong:`--add-drop-database --databases` to dumpoptions

mysqlhost
   MySQL host to connect to, default: :strong:`localhost`

mysqluser
   MySQL user. Default: unset, the user running the file-daemon will be used (usually root)

mysqlpassword
   MySQL password. Default: unset (better use :file:`my.cnf` to store passwords)

On restore, the database dumps are restored to the subdirectory :file:`_mysqlbackups_` in the restore path. The database restore must be triggered manually (:command:`mysql < _mysqlbackups_/DATABASENAME.sql`).

Backup of a MySQL Database by using the RunScript directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`\ <single: RunScript; Example>`\ 

One method to backup a MySQL database is to use the :command:`mysqldump` tool to dump the database into a file and then backup it as a normal file. After the backup, the file can be removed. It may also be an option not to remove it, so that the latest version is always available immediately. On the next job run it will be overwritten anyway.

This can be done by using :config:option:`dir/job/RunScript`\  directives, for example:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: RunScript job resource for a MySQL backup

   Job {
     Name = "BackupDatabase"
     JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
     Client = dbserver-fd
     Level = Full
     FileSet="Database"

     # This creates a dump of our database in the local filesystem on the Client
     RunScript {
       FailJobOnError = Yes
       RunsOnClient = Yes
       RunsWhen = Before
       Command = "sh -c 'mysqldump --user=<username> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases > /var/lib/bareos/mysql_dump.sql'"
     }

     # This deletes the dump in the local filesystem on the Client
     RunScript {
       RunsOnSuccess = Yes
       RunsOnClient = Yes
       RunsWhen = After
       Command = "rm /var/lib/bareos/mysql_dump.sql"
     }
   }

   FileSet {
     Name = "Database"
     Include {
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
     # database dump file
     File = "/var/lib/bareos/mysql_dump.sql" 
     }
   }

Note that redirecting the :command:`mysqldump` output to a file requires to run the whole command line through a shell, otherwise the :command:`mysqldump` would not know what do with the :command:`>` character and the job would fail. As no shell features like redirection or piping are used for the :command:`rm`, the :command:`sh -c` is not needed there. See :config:option:`dir/job/RunScript`\  for more details.

Backup of a MySQL Database by using the bpipe plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:index:`\ <single: bpipe; MySQL backup>`\ 

Instead of creating a temporary database dump file, the bpipe plugin can be used. For general information about bpipe, see the :ref:`bpipe` section. The bpipe plugin is configured inside the Include section of a File Set, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bpipe fileset for MySQL backup

   FileSet {
     Name = "mysql-all"
     Include {
       Plugin = "bpipe:file=/MYSQL/dump.sql:reader=mysqldump --user=<user> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases:writer=mysql --user=<user> --password=<password>"
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
     }
   }

This can also be used, to backup a database that is running on a remote host:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bpipe directive to backup a MySQL database that is running on a remote host

   FileSet{
     Name = "mysql-all"
     Include {
       Plugin = "bpipe:file=/MYSQL/dump.sql:reader=mysqldump --host=<hostname> --user=<user> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases:writer=mysql --host=<hostname> --user=<user> --password=<password>"
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
     }
   }

If you do not want a direct restore of your data in your plugin directive, as shown in the examples above, there is the possibility to restore the dump to the filesystem first, which offers you more control over the restore process, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bpipe directive to backup a MySQL database and restore the dump to the filesystem first

   FileSet{
     Name = "mysql-all"
     Include {
       Plugin = "bpipe:file=/MYSQL/dump.sql:reader=mysqldump --host=<hostname> --user=<user> --password=<password> --opt --all-databases:writer=/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/bpipe-restore.sh"
       Options {
         signature = MD5
         compression = gzip
       }
     }
   }

A very simple corresponding shell script (:command:`bpipe-restore.sh`) to the method above might look like the following one:

.. code-block:: bareosconfig
   :caption: bpipe shell script for a restore to filesystem

   #!/bin/bash
   cat - > /tmp/dump.sql
   exit 0

.. _section-StatisticCollection:

Statistics Collection
---------------------

Statistics Collection can be controlled by a number of configuration directives. If Statistics Collection is enabled, statistics are collected by the |dir| and stored into the Catalog database. So enabling this feature will increase your database size.

The Statistics are used by the |webui| to show the status of a running job. :index:`\ <single: Webui; Configure Statistics Collection>`\

.. _section-RemoveClient:

Removing a Client
-----------------

Removing a client can mean several things in Bareos context. You can disable the client so no jobs that use this client will run anymore. You can also remove the clientâ€™s configuration so that no job can use the client anymore. However, you will still have the client in your catalog unless you explicitly remove it.

Disable a client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to disable a client either by calling :bcommand:`disable client=<client-name>` or by setting :config:option:`dir/client/Enabled`\  to no. While the configuration change will persist across restarts, the command just disables the client temporarily.

When a client is disabled, the scheduler will not run any job for this client anymore, but you can still restore to it or manually trigger a job.

Remove configuration for client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to remove the client permanently, you can also completely remove the client from your configuration. This will make sure that no job (neither backup nor restore) can use that client machine. After removing the Client Resource from the director configuration, you will also need to change or remove all Job and JobDefs Resources in the Director configuration that reference the removed client.

Removing the client configuration does not remove the backed up data or the file and job records in the catalog for the client. You can still restore the data that has been backed up from the client to a different client.

Remove catalog records related to the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing the client from the configuration will leave you with catalog records concerning the client. If you donâ€™t want to restore any data backed up from the client anymore, you can call :bcommand:`purge jobs client=<client-name>`. This will remove all job and file records for the named client from the catalog. However, it will not remove the data from the volumes.



.. warning::
      
   After removing the job and file records you will be unable to restore the client's data.
   The :bcommand:`purge` command ignores retention policies, so please take careful.
   

As soon as all jobs for a client have been removed from the catalog that client record becomes orphaned. Orphaned client records usually stay in your database indefinitely, but if you want them removed for cosmetic reasons you can do so using "Check for orphaned Client records" in :command:`bareos-dbcheck`.

By default :command:`bareos-dbcheck` only lists the orphaned clients it finds. You need to enable the modify database flag to make it actually change the database.
