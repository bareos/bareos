This specifies the name of the catalog resource to be used for this Pool. When a catalog is defined in a Pool it will override the definition in the client (and the Catalog definition in a Job since :sinceVersion:`13.4.0: Job catalog overwritten by Pool catalog`). e.g. this catalog setting takes precedence over any other definition.
