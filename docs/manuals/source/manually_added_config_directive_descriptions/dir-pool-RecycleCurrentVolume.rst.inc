If Bareos needs a new Volume, this directive instructs Bareos to Prune the volume respecting the Job and File retention periods. If all Jobs are pruned (i.e. the volume is Purged), then the Volume is recycled and will be used as the next Volume to be written. This directive respects any Job, File, or Volume retention periods that you may have specified.

This directive can be useful if you have: a fixed number of Volumes in the Pool, you want to cycle through them, and you have specified retention periods that prune Volumes before you have cycled through the Volume in the Pool.

However, if you use this directive and have only one Volume in the Pool, you will immediately recycle your Volume if you fill it and Bareos needs another one. Thus your backup will be totally invalid. Please use this directive with care.
