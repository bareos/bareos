This is the host address of the database server. Normally, you would specify this instead of :config:option:`dir/catalog/DbSocket`\  if the database server is on another machine. In that case, you will also specify :config:option:`dir/catalog/DbPort`\ . This directive is used only by MySQL and PostgreSQL and is ignored by SQLite if provided.
