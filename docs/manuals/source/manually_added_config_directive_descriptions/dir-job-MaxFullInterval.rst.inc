The time specifies the maximum allowed age (counting from start time) of the most recent successful Full backup that is required in order to run Incremental or Differential backup jobs. If the most recent Full backup is older than this interval, Incremental and Differential backups will be upgraded to Full backups automatically. If this directive is not present, or specified as 0, then the age of the previous Full backup is not considered.
