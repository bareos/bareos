This option sets if there is Bandwidth Limiting in effect if the limiting code can use bursting e.g. when from a certain timeslice not all bandwidth is used this bandwidth can be used in a next timeslice. Which mean you will get a smoother limiting which will be much closer to the actual limit set but it also means that sometimes the bandwidth will be above the setting here.
