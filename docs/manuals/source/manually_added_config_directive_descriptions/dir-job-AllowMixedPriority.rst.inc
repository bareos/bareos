When set to :strong:`yes`, this job may run even if lower priority jobs are already running. This means a high priority job will not have to wait for other jobs to finish before starting. The scheduler will only mix priorities when all running jobs have this set to true.

Note that only higher priority jobs will start early. Suppose the director will allow two concurrent jobs, and that two jobs with priority 10 are running, with two more in the queue. If a job with priority 5 is added to the queue, it will be run as soon as one of the running jobs finishes. However, new priority 10 jobs will not be run until the priority 5 job has finished.
