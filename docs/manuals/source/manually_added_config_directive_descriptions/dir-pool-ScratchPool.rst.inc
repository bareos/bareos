This directive permits to specify a dedicate *Scratch* for the current pool. This pool will replace the special pool named *Scrach* for volume selection. For more information about *Scratch* see :ref:`Scratch Pool <TheScratchPool>` section of this manual. This is useful when using multiple storage sharing the same mediatype or when you want to dedicate volumes to a particular set of pool.
