The time specifies the maximum allowed time that a job may run, counted from when the job starts, (not necessarily the same as when the job was scheduled).

By default, the watchdog thread will kill any Job that has run more than 6 days. The maximum watchdog timeout is independent of :strong:`Max Run Time`\  and cannot be changed.
