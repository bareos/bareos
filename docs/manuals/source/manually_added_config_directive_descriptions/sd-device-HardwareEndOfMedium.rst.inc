All modern (after 1998) tape drives should support this feature. In doubt, use the btape program to test your drive to see whether or not it supports this function. If the archive device does not support the end of medium ioctl request \tt MTEOM, set this parameter to No. The storage daemon will then use the forward space file function to find the end of the recorded data. In addition, your SCSI driver must keep track of the file number on the tape and report it back correctly by
the MTIOCGET ioctl. Note, some SCSI drivers will correctly forward space to the end of the recorded data, but they do not keep track of the file number. On Linux machines, the SCSI driver has a fast-eod option, which if set will cause the driver to lose track of the file number. You should ensure that this option is always turned off using the mt program.
