This directive defines whether or not you want the names of the files that were saved to be put into the catalog. If disabled, the Catalog database will be significantly smaller. The disadvantage is that you will not be able to produce a Catalog listing of the files backed up for each Job (this is often called Browsing). Also, without the File entries in the catalog, you will not be able to use the Console :bcommand:`restore` command nor any other command that references File
entries.
