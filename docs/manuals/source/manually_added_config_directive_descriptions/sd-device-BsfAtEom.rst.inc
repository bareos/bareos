If :strong:`no`, no special action is taken by Bareos with the End of Medium (end of tape) is reached because the tape will be positioned after the last EOF tape mark, and Bareos can append to the tape as desired. However, on some systems, such as FreeBSD, when Bareos reads the End of Medium (end of tape), the tape will be positioned after the second EOF tape mark (two successive EOF marks indicated End of Medium). If Bareos appends from that point, all the appended data will be
lost. The solution for such systems is to specify :config:option:`sd/device/BsfAtEom = yes`\  which causes Bareos to backspace over the second EOF mark. Determination of whether or not you need this directive is done using the test command in the :command:`btape` program.
