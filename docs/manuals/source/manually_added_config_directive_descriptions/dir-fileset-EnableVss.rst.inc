:index:`\ <single: Windows; Enable VSS>`\  If this directive is set to :strong:`yes` the File daemon will be notified that the user wants to use a Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup for this job. This directive is effective only on the Windows File Daemon. It permits a consistent copy of open files to be made for cooperating writer applications, and for applications that are not VSS away, Bareos can at least copy open files. The Volume Shadow Copy will only be done on
Windows drives where the drive (e.g. C:, D:, ...) is explicitly mentioned in a :strong:`File`\  directive. For more information, please see the :ref:`Windows <VSS>` chapter of this manual.
