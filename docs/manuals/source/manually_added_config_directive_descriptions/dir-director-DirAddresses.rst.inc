Specify the ports and addresses on which the Director daemon will listen for Bareos Console connections.

Please note that if you use the :config:option:`dir/director/DirAddresses`\  directive, you must not use either a :config:option:`dir/director/DirPort`\  or a :config:option:`dir/director/DirAddress`\  directive in the same resource.
