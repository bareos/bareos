The time specifies the maximum allowed age (counting from start time) of the most recent successful Virtual Full backup that is required in order to run Incremental or Differential backup jobs. If the most recent Virtual Full backup is older than this interval, Incremental and Differential backups will be upgraded to Virtual Full backups automatically. If this directive is not present, or specified as 0, then the age of the previous Virtual Full backup is not considered.
