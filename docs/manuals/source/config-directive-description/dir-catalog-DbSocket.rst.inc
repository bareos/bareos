This is the name of a socket to use on the local host to connect to the database. This directive is used only by MySQL and is ignored by SQLite. Normally, if neither :config:option:`dir/catalog/DbSocket`\  or :config:option:`dir/catalog/DbAddress`\  are specified, MySQL will use the default socket. If the DB Socket is specified, the MySQL server must reside on the same machine as the Director.
