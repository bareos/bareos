This directive can be specified if this device is used with an autochanger and you want to overwrite the default :config:option:`sd/autochanger/ChangerCommand`\ . Normally, this directive will be specified only in the :ref:`StorageResourceAutochanger`, which is then used for all devices. However, you may also specify the different Changer Command in each Device resource.
