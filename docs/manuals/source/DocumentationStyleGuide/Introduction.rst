Introduction
============

This is a complete guide to the language and style conventions used for Bareos Documentation. The Sphinx tool has been used to produce a presentable documentation using the reStructuredText (reST) files present in https://github.com/bareos/bareos/tree/master/docs/manuals/source\ .

The primary output format is HTML.
It is doubtfull, is PDFs can be created easily (internally, Sphinx would convert to Latex first, and than use Latex to create the PDF).
