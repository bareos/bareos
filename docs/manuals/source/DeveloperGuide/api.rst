API

General
-------

This document is intended mostly for developers who wish to develop a
new GUI interface to **Bareos** or who want to script commands to the director
for automation purposes.

Minimal Code in Console Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the Catalog code is in the Directory (with the exception of
``dbcheck`` and ``bscan``). Therefore also user level security and
access is implemented in this central place. If code would be spreaded
everywhere such as in a GUI this will be more difficult. The other
advantage is that any code you add to the Director is automatically
available to all interface programs, like the tty console and other
programs.

GUI Interface is Difficult
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interfacing to an interactive program such as Bareos can be very
difficult because the interfacing program must interpret all the prompts
that may come. This can be next to impossible. There are are a number of
ways that Bareos is designed to facilitate this:

-  The Bareos network protocol is packet based, and thus pieces of
   information sent can be ASCII or binary.

-  The packet interface permits knowing where the end of a list is.

-  The packet interface permits special “signals” to be passed rather
   than data.

-  The Director has a number of commands that are non-interactive. They
   all begin with a period and provide things such as the list of all
   Jobs, list of all Clients, list of all Pools, list of all Storage, …
   Thus the GUI interface can get to virtually all information that the
   Director has in a deterministic way.

-  Most console commands allow all the arguments to be specified on the
   command line: e.g. :bcommand:`run job=NightlyBackup level=Full`

dot commands
------------

Besides the normal commands (like list, status, run, mount, ...) the
Director offers a number of so called *dot commands*. They all begin
with a period, are all non-interactive, easily parseable and are
indended to be used by other Bareos interface programs (GUIs).

The command :bcommand:`.help` shows a complete list of all dot commands.

-  ``.actiononpurge``
-  ``.api [ 0 | 1 | 2 | off | on | json ]``

   -  Switch between different :ref:`section-ApiMode`.

-  ``.clients``

   -  List all client resources

-  ``.catalogs``

   -  List all catalog resources

-  ``.defaults job=<job-name> | client=<client-name> | storage=<storage-name | pool=<pool-name>``

   -  List default settings

   -  List add JobDef resources

-  ``.jobs``

   -  List job resources

-  ``.levels``

   -  List all backup levels

.. _section-ApiMode:

API Modes
---------

The :bcommand:`.api` command can be used to switch between the different API
modes. Besides the :bcommand:`.api` command,
there is also the :bcommand:`gui on | off` command.
However, this command can be ignored, as it set to gui on in
command execution anyway.

API mode 0 (off)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    .api 0

By default, a console connection to the Director is in interactive mode,
meaning the api mode is off. This is the normal mode you get when using
the bconsole. The output should be human readable.

API mode 1 (on)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 16.2.0

To get better parsable output, a console connection could be switched to
API mode 1 (on).

::

    .api 1

or (from times when there was only one API flavour)

::

    .api

This mode is intended to create output that is easier to parse.
Internaly some commands vary their output for API mode 1.

In API mode 1 some output is only delimited by the end of a packet, not
by a new line. bconsole does not display the end of packets (for good
reason, as some output (e.g. :bcommand:`status`) is sent in multiple packets).
If running in a bconsole, this leads to unparsable output for human.

Example:

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.api 0
    api: 0
    *.defaults job=BackupClient1
    job=BackupClient1
    pool=Incremental
    messages=Standard
    client=client1.example.com-fd
    storage=File
    where=
    level=Incremental
    type=Backup
    fileset=SelfTest
    enabled=1
    catalog=MyCatalog
    *.api 1
    api: 1
    *.defaults job=BackupClient1
    job=BackupClient1pool=Incrementalmessages=Standardclient=client1.example.com-fdstorage=Filewhere=level=Incrementaltype=Backupfileset=SelfTestenabled=1catalog=MyCatalog

This mode has been introduced by BAT and is now deprecated.

-  :ref:`Signals <section-signals>`

API mode 2 (json)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API mode 2 (or JSON mode) has been introduced in Bareos-15.2 and
differs from API mode 1 in several aspects:

-  JSON output
-  The JSON output is in the format of JSON-RPC 2.0 responce objects
   (http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object). This should
   make it easier to implement a full JSON-RPC service later.
-  No user interaction inside a command (meaning: if not all parameters
   are given to a :bcommand:`run` command, the command fails).
-  Each command creates exactly one response object.

Currently a subset of the available commands return their result in JSON
format, while others still write plain text output.

A successful responce should return

.. code-block:: bconsole

    "result": {
        "<type_of_the_results>": [
            {
                <result_object_1_key_1>: <result_object_1_value_1>,
                <result_object_1_key_2>: <result_object_1_value_2>,
                ...
            },
            {
                <result_object_2_key_1>: <result_object_2_value_1>,
                <result_object_2_key_2>: <result_object_2_value_2>,
                ...
            },
            ...
        ]
    }

All keys are lower case.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

-  list

   -  e.g.

   .. code-block:: bconsole

       *list jobs
       {
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": null,
       "result": {
         "jobs": [
           {
             "type": "B",
             "starttime": "2015-06-25 16:51:38",

Example of a JSON-RPC Error Response
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Example of a JSON-RPC Error Response
(http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object):

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *gui
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": null,
      "error": {
        "data": {
          "result": {},
          "messages": {
            "error": [
              "ON or OFF keyword missing.\n"
            ]
          }
        },
        "message": "failed",
        "code": 1
      }
    }

-  an error response is emitted if the command returns false or emitted
   an error message
   (``void UAContext::error_msg(const char *fmt, ...)``). Messages and
   the result so far will be part of the error response object.

Bvfs API
--------

The BVFS (Bareos Virtual File System) do provide a API for browsing the
backed up files in the catalog and select files for restoring.

The Bvfs module works correctly with BaseJobs, Copy and Migration jobs.

The initial version in Bacula have be founded by Bacula Systems.

General notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  All fields are separated by a tab (api mode 0 and 1). (api mode 2:
   JSON format).

-  The output format for api mode 0 and 1 have changed for bareos >=
   17.2. In earlier versions the second column of the ``bvfs_lsdirs``,
   ``bvfs_lsfiles`` and ``bvfs_versions`` command have been the
   ``FilenameId``. As bareos >= 17.2 internally don’t use the
   ``FilenameId`` any longer, this column have been removed.

-  You can specify ``limit=`` and ``offset=`` to list smoothly records
   in very big directories. By default, limit=2000.

-  All operations (except cache creation) are designed to run instantly.

-  The cache creation is dependent of the number of directories. As Bvfs
   shares information across jobs, the first creation can be slow.

-  Due to potential encoding problem, it’s advised to use ``pathid``
   instead of ``path`` in queries.

.. limitation:: BVFS: bvfs_lsdirs limit/offset not working correctly on MySQL

  As described in :mantis:`975` the limit/offset does not work correctly for bvfs_lsdirs on MySQL.
  The problem has been fixed for PostgreSQL, but the SQL syntax required to formulate the query is unavailable on MySQL so there is no easy way to replicate that fix on MySQL.

Get dependent jobs from a given JobId
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bvfs allows you to query the catalog against any combination of jobs.
You can combine all Jobs and all FileSet for a Client in a single
session.

To get all JobId needed to restore a particular job, you can use the
``.bvfs_get_jobids`` command.

::

    .bvfs_get_jobids jobid=num [all]

Example:

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_get_jobids jobid=10
    1,2,5,10
    *.bvfs_get_jobids jobid=10 all
    1,2,3,5,10

In this example, a normal restore will need to use JobIds 1,2,5,10 to
compute a complete restore of the system.

With the ``all`` option, the Director will use all defined FileSet for
this client.

Generating Bvfs cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.bvfs_update`` command computes the directory cache for jobs
specified in argument, or for all jobs if unspecified.

::

    .bvfs_update [jobid=numlist]

Example:

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_update jobid=1,2,3

You can run the cache update process in a RunScript after the catalog
backup.

List directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bvfs allows you to list directories in a specific path.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_lsdirs pathid=num path=/apath jobid=numlist limit=num offset=num
    PathId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Path
    PathId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Path
    PathId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Path
    ...

In bareos < 17.2 the output has been:

::

    PathId  FilenameId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Path

You need to ``pathid`` or ``path``. Using ``path=`` will list “/” on
Unix and all drives on Windows.

FilenameId is 0 for all directories.

::

    *.bvfs_lsdirs pathid=4 jobid=1,11,12
    4       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     .
    5       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     ..
    3       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     regress/

In this example, to list directories present in ``regress/``, you can
use

::

    *.bvfs_lsdirs pathid=3 jobid=1,11,12
    3       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     .
    4       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     ..
    2       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     tmp/

List files
~~~~~~~~~~

API mode 0
^^^^^^^^^^

Bvfs allows you to list files in a specific path.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    .bvfs_lsfiles pathid=num path=/apath jobid=numlist limit=num offset=num
    PathId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Filename
    PathId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Filename
    PathId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Filename
    ...

In bareos < 17.2 the output has been:

::

    PathId  FilenameId  FileId  JobId  LStat  Filename

You need to ``pathid`` or ``path``. Using ``path=`` will list “/” on
Unix and all drives on Windows. If FilenameId is 0, the record listed is
a directory.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_lsdir pathid=4 jobid=1,11,12
    4       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     .
    5       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     ..
    1       0       0       A A A A A A A A A A A A A A     regress/

In this example, to list files present in ``regress/``, you can use

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_lsfiles pathid=1 jobid=1,11,12
    1   52   12    gD HRid IGk BAA I BMqcPH BMqcPE BMqe+t A     titi

API mode JSON contains all information also available in the other API
modes, but displays them more verbose.

Get all versions of a specific file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bvfs allows you to find all versions of a specific file for a given
Client with the ``.bvfs_version`` command. To avoid problems with
encoding, this function uses only PathId and FilenameId.

The jobid argument is mandatory but unused.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_versions jobid=0 client=filedaemon pathid=num fname=filename [copies] [versions]
    PathId FileId JobId LStat Md5 VolName InChanger
    PathId FileId JobId LStat Md5 VolName InChanger
    ...

Example:

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_versions jobid=0 client=localhost-fd pathid=1 fnane=toto
    1  49  12  gD HRid IGk D Po Po A P BAA I A   /uPgWaxMgKZlnMti7LChyA  Vol1  1

Restore set of files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bvfs allows you to create a SQL table that contains files that you want
to restore. This table can be provided to a restore command with the
file option.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_restore fileid=numlist dirid=numlist hardlink=numlist path=b2num
    OK
    *restore file=?b2num ...

To include a directory (with ``dirid``), Bvfs needs to run a query to
select all files. This query could be time consuming.

``hardlink`` list is always composed of a serie of two numbers (jobid,
fileindex). This information can be found in the LinkFileIndex (LinkFI)
field of the LStat packet.

The ``path`` argument represents the name of the table that Bvfs will
store results. The format of this table is ``b2[0-9]+``. (Should start
by b2 and followed by digits).

Example:

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_restore fileid=1,2,3,4 hardlink=10,15,10,20 jobid=10 path=b20001
    OK

Cleanup after Restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To drop the table used by the restore command, you can use the
``.bvfs_cleanup`` command.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_cleanup path=b20001

Clearing the BVFS Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To clear the BVFS cache, you can use the ``.bvfs_clear_cache`` command.

.. code-block:: bconsole

    *.bvfs_clear_cache yes
    OK

Example for directory browsing using bvfs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bconsole

    # update the bvfs cache for all jobs
    *.bvfs_update
    Automatically selected Catalog: MyCatalog
    Using Catalog "MyCatalog

    # Get jobids required to reconstruct a current full backup.
    # This is optional. Only required if you care about a full backup.
    # If you are only interessed in a single (differential or incremental) backup job,
    # just use the single jobid.
    *.bvfs_get_jobids jobid=123
    117,118,123

    # get root directory of the combined jobs 117,118,123
    *.bvfs_lsdir jobid=117,118,123 path=

    # Check the root directory for subdirectories.

    133 0   0   A A A A A A A A A A A A A A .

.. _sec:REST:

REST API
--------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an experimental and preliminary backend for development purposes. The endpoints are subject to review and may change in the future.

It provides a REST API using `fastapi <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_ and python-bareos to connect to
a Bareos director. It supports the :command:`configure add` commands to create configuration for clients, jobs, filesets and some more resources. It also provides endpoints to query job information and job control (i.e. start / restart jobs, trigger restores).

Python >= 3 is needed to run the REST API.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use pip to install:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   pip install bareos-restapi


This will also install dependencies like fastapi, uvicorn and some more.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure your Bareos Server in :file:`api.ini` adapting these 3 lines of configuration:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [Director]
   Name=bareos-dir
   Address=127.0.0.1
   Port=9101

To configure the webserver uvicorn (e.g. adapt used network interfaces, ports), read the `uvicorn
documentation <https://www.uvicorn.org/>`_. The default port is 8000 and the default interface is the loopback device.

Start the backend server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: shell-session

   uvicorn bareos_restapi:app --reload


Serve the Swagger UI to explore the REST API: `<http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>`_
Alternatively you can use the redoc format: `<http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc>`_


Browse
~~~~~~

The Swagger UI contains documentation and online-tests. Use "authorize" to connect to your Bareos director using a named console. Read here to learn how to configure
a named console: :ref:`DirectorResourceConsole`

The Swagger documentation also contains CURL statements for all available endpoints.

Future work
~~~~~~~~~~~

The API will be extended by some methods provided by the Bareos console, that are not yet implemented. It is also planned to add delete / update options for configuration in the director and REST API.
