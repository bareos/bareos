Laminas.0 introduces a new and powerful approach to modules. This new
module system is designed with flexibility, simplicity, and re-usability in mind.
A module may contain just about anything: PHP code, including MVC functionality;
library code; view scripts; and/or public assets such as images, CSS, and
JavaScript. The possibilities are endless.

`Laminas\ModuleManager` is the component that enables the design of a module
architecture for PHP applcations.
