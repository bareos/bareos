# Form Elements

A set of specialized elements are provided for accomplishing application-centric
tasks. These include several HTML5 input elements with matching server-side
validators, the `Csrf` element (to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery attacks),
and the `Captcha` element (to display and validate
[CAPTCHAs](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-captcha/)).

A `Factory` is provided to facilitate creation of elements, fieldsets, forms,
and the related input filter. See the [quick start](../quick-start.md#creation-via-factory)
for more information.
