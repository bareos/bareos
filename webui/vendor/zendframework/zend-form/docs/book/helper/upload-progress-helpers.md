# Upload Progress Helpers

zend-form provides several helpers to use in conjunction with
[zend-progressbar](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-progressbar) for the
puproses of rending upload progress information. These include:

- [FormFileApcProgress](form-file-apc-progress.md), which works with the APC
  extension.
- [FormFileSessionProgress](form-file-session-progress.md), which works with the
  built-in support via the session extension.
- [FormFileUploadProgress](form-file-upload-progress.md), which works with the
  UploadProgress extension.
