Small walk trough of libtool patch (what in there ...)

- Toplevel Makefile.in
   - Added depend definition for LIBTOOL
   - Rewrote some of the autoconf targets for the new name and always remove the cache autoconf makes
   - Updated some install targets to use the RMF macro (minor cleanup)
   - Remove libtool (which is autogenerated by configure) on make distclean

- autoconf/Make.common.in
   - Added libdir and includedir
   - Changed RM and RMF macros (See configure.in warning why its named @REMOVE@ now)
   - Small update in INSTALL_ macros to use the INSTALL_PROGRAM macro better and not have configure
     replace all the instances.
   - Added the LIBTOOL macros which are used when building with libtool (the DEFAULT_* macros
     are a workaround for easily disabling libtool and build in the old fashion way but still use
     the same Makefile.in everywhere.

- autoconf/aclocal.m4
   - Added libtool m4 files to be included

- autoconf/bacula-macros/db.m4
   - Updated all help strings to use the Autoconf AC_HELP_STRING function which formats help strings
     better so we never have to change those in the future (e.g. relayout ever again even when changing the content)

- autoconf/config.h.in
   - updated by configure run with libtool updates

- autoconf/config.on.save
   - removed redundant file (because things are in SVN don't see why you want this)

- autoconf/configure.in
   - This is a complete overhaul of the original file I reindented most stuff
     (killed all tabs ...) I think its better readable now and when changing it I think
     I also got some small bugs fixed. Also updated all comments to use dnl and not
     sometimes # and then dnl as comment. As we probably never gonna read the resulting
     configure script generated by autoconf anyhow I think using this style in configure.in is
     more consistent.
   - also added all libtool specific coding which gives us the --disable-libtool option
     which makes sure we can build everything using the old tools too. The LT_INIT is not in
     the if statement because it breaks the generated configure. So we always test for libtool
     but you can overwrite it usage by using the --disable-libtool option.

Todo:

- check if install of libs and includes also goes nicely when you don't do things like --prefix=/opt/ELMbacula
  e.g. where does the stuff then gets installed.
- do a full regression test on the new stuff build with libtool
- see how it works on a real install (currently running 72 hours with shared libs on Solaris 10 64 bits)
