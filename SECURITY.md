Besides the master-branch of the project, we maintain the three newest major releases.
Binary packages of maintenance releases for the major-branches are usually only shipped to customers with a subscription.
However, if such a release fixes a critical issue, we may consider releasing binary packages to the general public.

## Reporting a security issue

If you find a security-related problem in Bareos, please report it via e-mail to security@bareos.org.
We will try to respond to you within two days.
Please be patient with us.

Together with you, we will then determine a CVSS score and find out which versions of Bareos are vulnerable.
Based on that information we will decide what actions we will take.
