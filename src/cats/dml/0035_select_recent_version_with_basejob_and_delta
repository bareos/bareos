# We do the same thing than the query "select_recent_version_with_basejob",
# but we include all delta parts.
# If the file has been deleted, we can have irrelevant parts.
#
# The code that uses results should control the delta sequence with
# the following rules:
# First Delta = 0
# Delta = Previous Delta + 1
#
# If we detect a gap, we can discard further pieces
# If a file starts at 1 instead of 0, the file has been deleted, and further
# pieces are useless.
#
# This control should be reset for each new file
