 * Description:
 *	This contains the O/S (Operating System) specific
 *	portions of NDMJOBLIB for the Linux platform.
 *
 *	This file is #include'd by ndmos.c when
 *	selected by #ifdef's of NDMOS_ID.
 *
 *	There are four major portions:
 *	1) Misc support routines: password check, local info, etc
 *	2) Non-blocking I/O support routines
 *	3) Tape interfacs ndmos_tape_xxx()
 *	4) OS Specific NDMP request dispatcher which intercepts
 *	   requests implemented here, such as SCSI operations
 *	   and system configuration queries.
