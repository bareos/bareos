# 1. Set up backup job such that if it's doing a VF/consolidation it sleeps for up to 60s
# 2. Run 3 AI backups for consolidation
# 3. Start consolidation (-> will sleep for 60s)
# 4. Start incremental job
# 5. Wait for incremental job to finish
# 6. Cancel consolidation
# 7. Test succeeds if incremental job terminated successfully, i.e., not canceled as duplicate
#
# Same for copy/migration jobs which are also configured to sleep for 60s.
