# This systemtest tests the plugin functionality
# of the Bareos FD plugin bareos-fd-libcloud.py
#
# This test will start a s3minio server and populate it with some data.
# Then it runs a backup and a restore with the plugin.
# A full comparison is made afterwards.
# File attributes like uses and times will not be saved.
