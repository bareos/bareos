/**
 * The Storage daemon has three locking concepts that must be understood:
 *
 * 1. dblock    blocking the device, which means that the device
 *              is "marked" in use.  When setting and removing the
 *              block, the device is locked, but after dblock is
 *              called the device is unlocked.
 * 2. Lock()    simple mutex that locks the device structure. A Lock
 *              can be acquired while a device is blocked if it is not
 *              locked.
 * 3. rLock(locked) "recursive" Lock, when means that a Lock (mutex)
 *                  will be acquired on the device if it is not blocked
 *                  by some other thread. If the device was blocked by
 *                  the current thread, it will acquire the lock.
 *                  If some other thread has set a block on the device,
 *                  this call will wait until the device is unblocked.
 *                  Can be called with locked true, which means the
 *                  Lock is already set
 *
 * - A lock is normally set when modifying the device structure.
 * - A rLock is normally acquired when you want to block the device
 *   i.e. it will wait until the device is not blocked.
 * - A block is normally set during long operations like writing to the device.
 * - If you are writing the device, you will normally block and lock it.
 * - A lock cannot be violated. No other thread can touch the
 *   device while a lock is set.
 * - When a block is set, every thread accept the thread that set
 *   the block will block if rLock is called.
 * - A device can be blocked for multiple reasons, labeling, writing,
 *   acquiring (opening) the device, waiting for the operator, unmounted,
 *   ...
 *
 * Under certain conditions the block that is set on a device can be
 * stolen and the device can be used by another thread. For example,
 * a device is blocked because it is waiting for the operator to
 * mount a tape.  The operator can then unmount the device, and label
 * a tape, re-mount it, give back the block, and the job will continue.
 *
 * Functions:
 *
 * Device::Lock()   does P(mutex_)     (in dev.h)
 * Device::Unlock() does V(mutex_)
 *
 * Device::rLock(locked) allows locking the device when this thread
 *                       already has the device blocked.
 * - if (!locked)
 *   Lock()
 * - if blocked and not same thread that locked
 *   pthread_cond_wait
 * - leaves device locked
 *
 * Device::rUnlock() Unlocks but does not unblock same as Unlock();
 *
 * Device::dblock(why) does
 * - rLock();         (recursive device lock)
 * - BlockDevice(this, why)
 * - rUnlock()
 *
 * Device::dunblock does
 * - Lock()
 * - UnblockDevice()
 * - Unlock()
 *
 * BlockDevice() does (must be locked and not blocked at entry)
 * - set blocked status
 * - set our pid
 *
 * UnblockDevice() does (must be blocked at entry)
 * - (locked on entry)
 * - (locked on exit)
 * - set unblocked status
 * - clear pid
 * - if waiting threads
 *   pthread_cond_broadcast
 *
 * StealDeviceLock() does (must be locked and blocked at entry)
 * - save status
 * - set new blocked status
 * - set new pid
 * - Unlock()
 *
 * GiveBackDeviceLock() does (must be blocked but not locked)
 * - Lock()
 * - reset blocked status
 * - save previous blocked
 * - reset pid
 * - if waiting threads
 *   pthread_cond_broadcast
