 * This implements a device abstraction that provides so called chunked
 * volumes. These chunks are kept in memory and flushed to the backing
 * store when requested. This class fully abstracts the chunked volumes
 * for the upper level device. The stacking for this device type is:
 *
 * <actual_device_type>::
 *          |
 *          v
 *   chunked_device::
 *          |
 *          v
 *       Device::
 *
 * The public interfaces exported from this device are:
 *
 * SetInflightChunk() - Set the inflight flag for a chunk.
 * ClearInflightChunk() - Clear the inflight flag for a chunk.
 * IsInflightChunk() - Is a chunk current inflight to the backing store.
 * NrInflightChunks() - Number of chunks inflight to the backing store.
 * SetupChunk() - Setup a chunked volume for reading or writing.
 * ReadChunked() - Read a chunked volume.
 * WriteChunked() - Write a chunked volume.
 * CloseChunk() - Close a chunked volume.
 * TruncateChunkedVolume() - Truncate a chunked volume.
 * ChunkedVolumeSize() - Get the current size of a volume.
 * LoadChunk() - Make sure we have the right chunk in memory.
 *
 * It also demands that the inheriting class implements the
 * following methods:
 *
 * FlushRemoteChunk() - Flush a chunk to the remote backing store.
 * ReadRemoteChunk() - Read a chunk from the remote backing store.
 * chunked_remote_volume_size - Return the current size of a volume.
 * TruncateRemoteChunkedVolume() - Truncate a chunked volume on the
 *                                    remote backing store.
