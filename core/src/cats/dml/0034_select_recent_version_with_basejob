# Get the list of the last recent version per Delta with a given jobid list
# This is a tricky part because with SQL the result of
#
# SELECT MAX(A), B, C, D FROM... GROUP BY (B,C)
#
# doesn't give the good result (for D).
#
# With PostgreSQL, we can use DISTINCT ON(), but with Mysql or Sqlite,
# we need an extra join using JobTDate.
