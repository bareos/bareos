The file magic.bareos can be added to your system files so that the
file command will recognize Bareos Volumes as such.

If I understand this correctly, you add that to the database of
"magic" that the command file uses.

See 'man 1 file' and 'man 5 magic'.  On my system, there are
many ways to add to the magic.  For testing, you'd add it to
/etc/magic, usually.

This is an interesting contribution that might also be
relevant to the maintainers of magic, IMO.
