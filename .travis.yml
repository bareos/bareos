# This project also uses Coverity Scan https://scan.coverity.com/
# However, the Travis coverity scan addon (as of 19.02.2014) does not fit our needs,
# because then all builds are done as covertiy scans and results send to the server.
# Therefore we reused the old method
# (setting environment variables, download and execute a script).
